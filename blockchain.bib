Yet, it has remained a partially open question: how robust are such protocols? We consider a natural extension of the random phone-call model (introduced by Karp et al. [1]), and we analyze two different notions of robustness: the ability to tolerate adaptive failures, and the ability to tolerate oblivious failures.For adaptive failures, we present a new gossip protocol, TrickleGossip, which achieves near-optimal O(n log3 n) message complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first epidemic-style protocol that can tolerate adaptive failures. We also show a direct relation between resilience and message complexity, demonstrating that gossip protocols which tolerate a large number of adaptive failures need to use a super-linear number of messages with high probability.For oblivious failures, we present a new gossip protocol, CoordinatedGossip, that achieves optimal O(n) message complexity. This protocol makes novel use of the universe reduction technique to limit the message complexity.},

	shorttitle = {{\AE}{GIS}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05987},
	abstract = {In recent years, smart contracts have suffered major exploits, costing millions of dollars. Unlike traditional programs, smart contracts are deployed on a blockchain. As such, they cannot be modified once deployed. Though various tools have been proposed to detect vulnerable smart contracts, the majority fails to protect vulnerable contracts that have already been deployed on the blockchain. Only very few solutions have been proposed so far to tackle the issue of post-deployment. However, these solutions suffer from low precision and are not generic enough to prevent any type of attack. In this work, we introduce \{{\textbackslash}AE\}GIS, a dynamic analysis tool that protects smart contracts from being exploited during runtime. Its capability of detecting new vulnerabilities can easily be extended through so-called attack patterns. These patterns are written in a domain-specific language that is tailored to the execution model of Ethereum smart contracts. The language enables the description of malicious control and data flows. In addition, we propose a novel mechanism to streamline and speed up the process of managing attack patterns. Patterns are voted upon and stored via a smart contract, thus leveraging the benefits of tamper-resistance and transparency provided by the blockchain. We compare \{{\textbackslash}AE\}GIS to current state-of-the-art tools and demonstrate that our solution achieves higher precision in detecting attacks. Finally, we perform a large-scale analysis on the first 4.5 million blocks of the Ethereum blockchain, thereby confirming the occurrences of well reported and yet unreported attacks in the wild.},

	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/554},
	abstract = {Current permissionless cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin suffer from a limited transaction rate and slow confirmation time, which hinders their large scale adoption. Payment channels are one of the most promising solutions to address these problems, as they allow two end-points of the channel to perform arbitrarily many payments in a peer-to-peer fashion while uploading only two transactions on the blockchain. This concept has been generalized into payment-channel networks where a path of payment channels is used to settle the payment between two users that might not share a channel between them. However, this approach requires the active involvement of each user in the path, making the system less reliable (they might be offline), more expensive (they charge fees per payment) and slower (intermediaries need to be actively involved in the payment). To mitigate this issue, recent work has introduced the concept of virtual channels, which involve intermediaries only in the initial creation of a bridge between payer and payee, who can later on independently perform arbitrarily many off-chain transactions. Unfortunately, existing constructions are only available for Ethereum, as they rely on its account model and Turing-complete scripting language. The realization of virtual channels in other blockchain technologies with limited scripting capabilities, like Bitcoin, was considered so far an open challenge.},

@techreport{benhamouda2020can,
	title = {Can a {Blockchain} {Keep} a {Secret}?},
	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/464},
	abstract = {Blockchains are gaining traction and acceptance, not just for cryptocurrencies but increasingly as a general-purpose architecture for distributed computing. In this work we seek solutions that allow a blockchain to act as a trusted long-term repository of secret information: Our goal is to deposit a secret with the blockchain and specify how to use it (e.g., the conditions under which it is released), and have the blockchain keep this information secret and use it only in the requested manner (e.g., only release it once the conditions are met). This simple functionality would be an enabler for many powerful applications, including signing statements on behalf of the blockchain, using blockchain as the control plane for a storage system, performing decentralized program-obfuscation-as-a-service, and many more.

We present a scalable solution for implementing this functionality on a public proof-of-stake blockchain, in the presence of a mobile adversary controlling a small minority of the stake, using proactive secret sharing techniques. The main challenge is that, on the one hand, scalability requires that we use small committees to represent the entire stake, but, on the other hand, a mobile adversary may be able to corrupt the entire committee if it is small. For this reason, prior proactive secret sharing solutions are either non-scalable or insecure in our setting.

We solve this issue using "player replaceability", where the committee is anonymous until after it performs its actions, as in the Algorand blockchain.

	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/476},
	abstract = {The widespread adoption of decentralized cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, is currently hindered by their inherently limited transaction rate. One of the most prominent proposals to tackle this scalability issue are payment channels which allow mutually distrusted parties to exchange an arbitrary number of payments in the form of off-chain authenticated messages while posting only a limited number of transactions onto the blockchain. Specifically, two transactions suffice, unless a dispute between these parties occurs, in which case more on-chain transactions are required to restore the correct balance. Unfortunately, popular constructions, such as the Lightning network for Bitcoin, suffer from heavy communication complexity both off-chain and on-chain in case of dispute. Concretely, the communication overhead grows exponentially and linearly, respectively, in the number of applications that run in the channel. In this work, we introduce and formalize the notion of generalized channels for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies. Generalized channels significantly extend the concept of payment channels so as to perform off-chain any operation supported by the underlying blockchain. Besides the gain in expressiveness, generalized channels outperform state-of-the-art payment channel constructions in efficiency, reducing the communication complexity and the on-chain footprint in case of disputes to linear and constant, respectively. We provide a cryptographic instantiation of generalized channels that is compatible with Bitcoin, leveraging adaptor signatures -- a cryptographic primitive already used in the cryptocurrency literature but formalized as a standalone primitive in this work for the first time. We formally prove the security of our construction in the Universal Composability framework. Furthermore, we conduct an experimental evaluation, demonstrating the expressiveness and performance of generalized channels when used as building blocks for popular off-chain applications, such as channel splitting and payment-channel networks.},

	abstract = {Pedersen commitments have been adopted by several cryptocurrencies for hiding transaction amounts. While Pedersen commitments are perfectly hiding in isolation, the cryptocurrency transaction rules can reveal relationships between the amounts hidden in the commitments involved in the transaction. Such relationships can be combined with the public coin creation schedule to provide upper bounds on the number of coins in a commitment. In this paper, we consider the Grin cryptocurrency and derive upper bounds on the number of coins which can be present in regular transaction outputs. In a March 2020 snapshot of the Grin blockchain, we find that out of the 110,149 unspent regular transaction outputs 983 of them have less than 1800 grin (number of coins typically minted in half an hour) stored in them. On the other hand, 95\% of the unspent regular transaction outputs in the snapshot have an upper bound which is at least 90\% of the total Grin supply at their respective block heights. We conclude that while our method does not violate the confidentiality of the amounts in most of the outputs on the Grin blockchain, the amounts in some outputs can be estimated to be in a narrow range.},

	abstract = {Contract fraud is a big nuisance in our society. People are scammed largely because of vague language used in contracts, which can cause misunderstandings. Therefore, people will seek professional help to review over ambiguous terms, especially, when signing a big contract, for example, leasing or buying property. With the advent of Ethereum blockchain, a new type of contract, named smart contract, is emerging nowadays, enabling people to describe a complicated logic as an automatically executable computer program. However, due to the lack of the computer background and software development experience, many people have difficulty in understanding blockchain-based smart contracts, which is adverse to the popularization of Ethereum. It has resulted in a new wave of contract fraud caused by smart contracts, which are self-executing and self-enforcing but also hard to understand by people. To fill this huge gap, we propose an approach to enable people without computer background to understand and operate Ethereum smart contracts. In doing so, smart contract fraud can be deterred if people have a better understanding of contract terms. Particularly, we investigate the general rules of the smart contract code, and build a novel tool named SMTranslator to automatically generate readable document. SMTranslator first translates smart contracts into standard structured files and identifies the core statement of each function in smart contracts. By exploiting the custom natural language generation, we generate the documents for smart contracts that can provide correct and understandable descriptions. We collect numerous contracts in Ethereum and select a number of typical contracts to conduct the experiments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.},

	abstract = {Most of blockchains do not scale well, i.e., they cannot process quickly large amounts of transactions. Moreover, using blockchains can be expensive in real life, since blockchain operations cost fees. One of the remedies for these problem are {\textbackslash}emph\{off-chain\} (or: {\textbackslash}emph\{Layer-2\}) protocols where the massive bulk of transactions is kept outside of the main blockchain. In the optimistic case, off-chain protocols drastically improve scalability, since typically the users only need to communicate with the blockchain when they enter, or when they exit the system. In the pessimistic case when parties are malicious a ``smart contract'' running on the underlying blockchain guarantees that no coins are stolen. In this work we initiate the study of the inherent limitations of off-chain protocols. Concretely, we investigate the so-called {\textbackslash}emph\{Plasma\} systems (also called ``commit chains''), and show that malicious parties can always launch an attack that forces the honest parties to communicate large amounts of data to the blockchain. More concretely: the adversary can always (a) either force the honest parties to communicate a lot with the blockchain, even though they did not intend to (this is traditionally called {\textbackslash}emph\{mass exit\}); or (b) an honest party that wants to leave the system needs to quickly communicate large amounts of data to the blockchain. What makes these attacks particularly hard to handle in real life (and also making our result stronger) is that these attacks do not have so-called {\textbackslash}emph\{uniquely attributable faults\}, i.e.{\textasciitilde}the smart contract cannot determine which party is malicious, and hence cannot force it to pay the fees for the blockchain interaction.

An important implication of our result is that the benefits of two of the most prominent Plasma types, called {\textbackslash}emph\{Plasma Cash\} and {\textbackslash}emph\{Fungible Plasma\}, cannot be achieved simultaneously. Our results apply to every Plasma system, and cannot be circumvent by introducing additional cryptographic assumptions.},

	abstract = {{\textbackslash}emph\{Off-chain channel networks\} are one of the most promising technologies for dealing with blockchain scalability and delayed finality issues. Parties that are connected within such networks can send coins to each other without interacting with the blockchain. Moreover, these payments can be ``routed'' over the network. Thanks to this, even the parties that do not have a channel in common can perform payments between each other with the help of intermediaries.

In this paper, we introduce a new notion that we call {\textbackslash}emph\{Non-Atomic Payment Splitting (NAPS) protocols\} that allow the intermediaries in the network to split the payments recursively into several sub-payments in such a way that the payment can be successful ``partially'' (i.e.{\textasciitilde}not all the requested amount may be transferred). This is in contrast with the existing splitting techniques that are ``atomic'' in the sense that they did not allow such partial payments (we compare the ``atomic'' and ``non-atomic'' approach in the paper). We define NAPS formally, and then present a protocol, that we call ``EthNA'', that satisfies this definition. EthNA is based on very simple and efficient cryptographic tools, and in particular does not use any expensive cryptographic primitives. We implement a simple variant of EthNA in Solidity and provide some benchmarks. We also report on some experiments with routing using EthNA.},

Operationally, our construction shows how to view any family of blockchains as a unified, virtual ledger without requiring any coordination among the chains or any new protocol metadata. Users of the system have the option to inject a transaction into a single constituent blockchain or--if they desire accelerated settlement--all of the constituent blockchains. Our presentation and proofs introduce a new formalism for reasoning about blockchains, the dynamic ledger, and articulate our constructions as transformations of dynamic ledgers that amplify security.

However, many bugs and vulnerabilities have been identified in many contracts which raises serious concerns about smart contract security, not to mention that the blockchain systems on which the smart contracts are built can be buggy. Thus, there is a significant need to better maintain smart contract code and ensure its high reliability. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to learn characteristics of smart contracts in Solidity, which is useful for clone detection, bug detection and contract validation on smart contracts. Our new approach is based on word embeddings and vector space comparison. We parse smart contract code into word streams with code structural information, convert code elements (e.g., statements, functions) into numerical vectors that are supposed to encode the code syntax and semantics, and compare the similarities among the vectors encoding code and known bugs, to identify potential issues. We have implemented the approach in a prototype, named SmartEmbed. Results show that our tool can effectively identify many repetitive instances of Solidity code, where the clone ratio is around 90{\textbackslash}\%. Code clones such as type-III or even type-IV semantic clones can also be detected accurately. Our tool can identify more than 1000 clone related bugs based on our bug databases efficiently and accurately. Our tool can also help to efficiently validate any given smart contract against a known set of bugs, which can help to improve the users' confidence in the reliability of the contract.

	abstract = {Nakamoto's famous blockchain protocol enables achieving consensus in a so-called permissionless setting--anyone can join (or leave) the protocol execution, and the protocol instructions do not depend on the identities of the players. His ingenious protocol prevents ``sybil attacks'' (where an adversary spawns any number of new players) by relying on computational puzzles (a.k.a. ``moderately hard functions'') introduced by Dwork and Naor (Crypto'92). Recent work by Garay et al (EuroCrypt'15) and Pass et al. (EuroCrypt'17) demonstrate that this protocol provably achieves consistency and liveness assuming a) honest players control a majority of the computational power in the network, b) the puzzle-difficulty is appropriately set as a function of the maximum network message delay and the total computational power of the network, and c) the computational puzzle is modeled as a random oracle.

These works, however, leave open the question of how to set the puzzle difficulty in a setting where the computational power in the network is changing. Nakamoto's protocol indeed also includes a description of a difficutly update procedure. A recent work by Garay et al. (Crypto'17) indeed shows a variant of this difficulty adjustment procedure can be used to get a sound protocol as long as the computational power does not change too fast --- however, under two restrictions: 1) their analysis assumes that the attacker cannot delays network messages, and 2) the changes in computational power in the network changes are statically set (i.e., cannot be adaptively selected by the adversary). In this work, we show the same result but without these two restrictions, demonstrating the soundness of a (slightly different) difficulty update procedure, assuming only that the computational power in the network does not change too fast (as a function of the maximum network message delays); as an additional contribution, our analysis yields a tight bound on the ``chain quality'' of the protocol.},

	abstract = {Nakamoto consensus, arguably the most exciting development in distributed computing in the last few years, is in a sense a recasting of the traditional state-machine-replication problem in an unauthenticated setting, where furthermore parties come and go without warning. The protocol relies on a cryptographic primitive known as proof of work (PoW) which is used to throttle message passing with the PoW difficulty level being adjusted appropriately throughout the course of the protocol execution.

While the original formulation was only accompanied by rudimentary analysis, significant and steady progress has been made in abstracting out the protocol{\textquoteright}s properties and providing a formal analysis under various restrictions, starting with the work by Garay, Kiayias and Leonardos [Eurocrypt {\textquoteright}15], for a simplified version of the protocol which excluded PoW difficulty adjustment and assumed a fixed number of parties as well as synchronous communication rounds. These assumptions have since been somewhat relaxed, first by Pass, Seeman and Shelat [Eurocrypt {\textquoteright}17] who also focused on the simplified version of the protocol but on the bounded-delay model of communication, and by Garay, Kiayias and Leonardos [Crypto {\textquoteright}17] who looked into the full protocol including the PoW difficulty adjustment mechanism with a variable number of parties but assuming synchronous communication and a predetermined schedule of participation. Despite the above progress, the full analysis of the protocol in the more realistic setting of bounded delays and dynamic participation has remained elusive.

This paper{\textquoteright}s main result is the proof that Nakamoto{\textquoteright}s protocol achieves, under suitable conditions, consistency and liveness in bounded-delay networks with adaptive (as opposed to predetermined) dynamic participation assuming, as before, that the majority of the computational power favors the honest parties.

	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/328},
	abstract = {Existing Nakamoto-style blockchains (NSBs) rely on some sort of synchrony assumption to offer any type of safety guarantees. A basic requirement is that when a party produces a new block, then all previously produced blocks should be known to that party, as otherwise the new block might not append the current head of the chain, creating a fork. In practice, however, the network delay for parties to receive messages is not a known constant, but rather varies over time. The consequence is that the parameters of the blockchain need to be set such that the time between the generation of two blocks is typically larger than the network delay (e.g.,minutes in Bitcoin) to guarantee security even under bad network conditions. This results in lost efficiency for two reasons: (1) Since blocks are produced less often, there is low throughput. Furthermore, (2) blocks can only be considered final, and thus the transactions inside confirmed, once they are extended by sufficiently many other blocks, which incurs a waiting time that is a multiple of 10 minutes. This is true even if the actual network delay is onlysecond, meaning that NSBs are slow even under good network conditions. We show how the Bitcoin protocol can be adjusted such that we preserve Bitcoin's security guarantees in the worst case, and in addition, our protocol can produce blocks arbitrarily fast and achieve optimistic responsiveness. The latter means that in periods without corruption, the confirmation time only depends on the (unknown) actual network delay instead of the known upper bound. Technically, we propose an approach where blocks are treated differently in the ``longest chain rule''. The crucial parameter of our protocol is a weight function assigning different weight to blocks according to their hash value. We present a framework for analyzing different weight functions, in which we prove all statements at the appropriate level of abstraction. This allows us to quickly derive protocol guarantees for different weight functions. We exemplify the usefulness of our framework by capturing the classical Bitcoin protocol as well as exponentially growing functions as special cases, where the latter provide the above mentioned guarantees, including optimistic responsiveness.},

One such option is stake representation, such that users can delegate their participation rights and, in the process, form "stake pools". The core idea is that stake pool operators always participate on behalf of regular users, while the users retain the ownership of their assets. Our work provides a formal PoS wallet construction that enables delegation and stake pool formation. While investigating the construction of addresses in this setting, we distil and explore address malleability, a security property that captures the ability of an attacker to manipulate the delegation information associated with an address. Our analysis consists of identifying multiple levels of malleability, which are taken into account in our paper{\textquoteright}s core result. We then introduce the first ideal functionality of a PoS wallet{\textquoteright}s core which captures the PoS wallet{\textquoteright}s capabilities and is realized as a secure protocol based on standard cryptographic primitives. Finally, we cover how to use the wallet core in conjunction with a PoS ledger, as well as investigate how delegation and stake pools affect a PoS system{\textquoteright}s security.},

	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/269},
	abstract = {Decades of research in both cryptography and distributed systems has extensively studied the problem of state machine replication, also known as Byzantine consensus. A consensus protocol must satisfy two properties: consistency and liveness. These properties ensure that honest participating nodes agree on the same log and dictate when fresh transactions get added. They fail, however, to ensure against adversarial manipulation of the actual ordering of transactions in the log. Indeed, in leader-based protocols (almost all protocols used today), malicious leaders can directly choose the final transaction ordering.

To rectify this problem, we propose a third consensus property: transaction order-fairness. We initiate the first formal investigation of order-fairness and explain its fundamental importance. We provide several natural definitions for order-fairness and analyze the assumptions necessary to realize them.

We also propose a new class of consensus protocols called Aequitas. Aequitas protocols are the first to achieve order-fairness in addition to consistency and liveness. They can be realized in a black-box way using existing broadcast and agreement primitives (or indeed using any consensus protocol), and work in both synchronous and asynchronous network models.},

	abstract = {Collateral employed in cryptoeconomic protocols protects against the misbehavior of economically rational agents, compensating honest users for damages and punishing misbehaving parties. The introduction of collateral, however, carries three disadvantages: (i) requiring agents to lock up a substantial amount of collateral can be an entry barrier, limiting the set of candidates to wealthy agents; (ii) affected agents incur ongoing opportunity costs as the collateral cannot be utilized elsewhere; and (iii) users wishing to interact with an agent on a frequent basis (e.g., with a service provider to facilitate second-layer payments), have to ensure the correctness of each interaction individually instead of subscribing to a service period in which interactions are secured by the underlying collateral.

We present Promise, a subscription mechanism to decrease the initial capital requirements of economically rational service providers in cryptoeconomic protocols. The mechanism leverages future income (such as service fees) prepaid by users to reduce the collateral actively locked up by service providers, while sustaining secure operation of the protocol. Promise is applicable in the context of multiple service providers competing for users. We provide a model for evaluating its effectiveness and argue its security. Demonstrating Promise's applicability, we discuss how Promise can be integrated into a cross-chain interoperability protocol, XCLAIM, and a second-layer scaling protocol, NOCUST. Last, we present an implementation of the protocol on Ethereum showing that all functions of the protocol can be implemented in constant time complexity and Promise only adds USD 0.05 for a setup per user and service provider and USD 0.01 per service delivery during the subscription period.},

This method is relying on standard Decisional Diffie-Hellman security assumptions and can result in efficient accountable ring signature schemes [4] and proofs of set memberships [5] with a signature size smaller than all existing alternative schemes relying on standard assumptions. This construction also serves as a fundamental building block for numerous recent blockchain privacy protocols including Anonymous Zether, Zerocoin, Lelantus, Lelantus-MW, Triptych and Triptych-2. One-out-of-many proofs require O(logN)-sized communication and can be implemented in O(N) time for the verifier and O(NlogN) time for the prover. In this work, we introduce a new method of instantiating one-out-of-many proofs which reduces the proof generation time by an order of magnitude. In certain practical applications our method also helps to fasten the verification process of multiple simultaneously generated proofs. Our approach still results in shorter proofs comprised of only a logarithmic number of commitments and does not compromise the highly efficient batch verification properties endemic to the original construction.

During these periods an attacker can mount devastating attacks, such as double spending or censorship of transactions. Checkpointing has been proposed as a mechanism to mitigate such 51\% attacks. The core idea is to employ an external set of parties that securely run an assisting service which guarantees the ledger's properties and can be relied upon at times when the invested hashing power is low. We realize the assisting service in two ways, via checkpointing and timestamping, and show that a ledger, which employs either, is secure with high probability, even in the presence of an adversarial mining majority. We put forth the first rigorous study of checkpointing as a mechanism to protect PoW ledgers from 51\% attacks. Notably, our design is the first to offer both consistency and liveness guarantees, even under adversarial mining majorities. Our liveness analysis also identifies a previously undocumented attack, namely front-running, which enables Denial-of-Service against existing checkpointed ledger systems. We showcase the liveness guarantees of our mechanism by evaluating the checkpointed version of Ethereum Classic, a blockchain which recently suffered a 51\% attack, and build a federated distributed checkpointing service, which provides high assurance with low performance requirements. Finally, we prove the security of our timestamping mechanism, build a fully decentralized timestamping solution, by utilizing a secure distributed ledger, and evaluate its performance on the existing Bitcoin and Ethereum systems.},

This results in a ledger protocol which is provably secure if the reputation system is accurate, and preserves its basic safety properties even if it is not, as long as the majority of the stake in the system remains in honest hands. Our results put emphasis on reputation fairness as a key feature of any reputation-based lottery.

Our objective is for personal computers, cloud virtual machines or containers, even mobile devices, and hopefully future IoT devices, to become the main, widely distributed, collectively much securer, fairer, more reliable and economically sustainable mining workforce for blockchains. An immediate question arises: how to prevent the permissionless network from being flooded of block dissemination traffic by a massive number of profit enthusiastic miners? We propose a novel notion of \{{\textbackslash}em Decentralized Clock/Time\} (DC/DT) as global and logical clock/time which can be agreed upon as a consensus. Our construction of DC/DT practically uses distributed private clocks of the participation nodes. With DC/DT, a node upon creating or hearing a block can know how luckily short or unluckily long time for the block to have been mined and/or traveled through the network. They can ``time throttle'' a potentially large number of unluckily mined/travelled blocks. The luckier blocks passing through the time throttle are treated as time-tie forks with a volume being ``throttle diameter'' adjustably controlled not to congest the network. With the number of time-tie forks being manageable, it is then easy to break-tie elect a winner, or even to orderly queue a plural number of winners for a ``multi-core'' utilization of resource. We provide succinct and evident analyses of necessary properties for the LotMint blockchain including: decentralization, energy saving, safety, liveness, robustness, fairness, anti-denial-of-service, anti-sybil, anti-censorship, scaled-up transaction processing throughput and sped-up payment confirmation time.},

Many commonly used SNARK systems rely on a structured reference string, the secure generation of which turns out to be their Achilles heel: If the randomness used for the generation is known, the soundness of the proof system can be broken with devastating consequences for the underlying blockchain system that utilises them. In this work we describe and analyze, for the first time, a blockchain mechanism that produces a secure SRS with the characteristic that security is shown for the exact same conditions under which the blockchain protocol is proven to be secure. Our mechanism makes use of the recent discovery of updateable structure reference strings to perform this secure generation in a fully distributed manner. In this way, the SRS emanates from the normal operation of the blockchain protocol itself without the need of additional security assumptions or off-chain computation and/or verification. We provide concrete guidelines for the parameterisation of this system which allows for the completion of a secure setup in a reasonable period of time.

In this paper, we give a formalisation of this problem, and we prove that blockchain interoperability is impossible according to the classical definition of a blockchain. Under a weaker definition of blockchain, we demonstrate that two blockchains are interoperable is equivalent to creating a `2-in-1' blockchain containing both ledgers, thus limiting the theoretical interest of making interoperable blockchains in the first place. We also observe that all practical existing interoperable blockchain frameworks work indeed by exchanging already created tokens between two blockchains and not by offering the possibility to transfer tokens from one blockchain to another one, which implies a modification of the balance of total created tokens on both blockchains. It confirms that having interoperability is only possible by creating a `2-in-1' blockchain containing both ledgers.},

Payment griefing is one of the identified attacks on PCNs{\textquoteright} liquidity, where the payee withholds the preimage in Hash Time Locked Contract. Before this payment expires, coins involved in this payment cannot be used in other payments. We introduce Bankrun attack, which exploits payment griefing to bank run PCNs. Bankrun in finance means numerous clients withdraw their money from a bank, which makes the bank insolvent and even bankrupted. In our Bankrun attack, the attacker generates sybil nodes, establishes channels with hubs in the network, makes payments between his nodes and griefs them simultaneously. If the adversary has sufficient coins, he can lock a high percentage of coins in the PCN, so that the PCN may no longer handle normal payments. We introduce a framework for launching Bankrun attacks, and develop three strategies with a focus on minimising the cost, draining important channels, and locking most amount of coins, respectively. We evaluate the effectiveness of Bankrun attacks on Bitcoin{\textquoteright}s Lightning Network, the first and most well-known PCN. Our evaluation results show that, using channels with 1.5\% richest nodes, the attacker can lock 83\% of the capacity in the entire network.

This adoption has motivated research from both academia and industry.

Payment channels suffer from security vulnerabilities, such as the wormhole attack, anonymity issues, and scalability limitations related to the upper bound on the number of concurrent payments per channel, which have been pointed out by the scientific community but never quantitatively analyzed.

In this work, we first analyze the proneness of the LN to the wormhole attack and attacks against anonymity. We observe that an adversary needs to control only 2\% of LN nodes to learn sensitive payment information (e.g., sender, receiver and payment amount) or to carry out the wormhole attack. Second, we study the management of concurrent payments in the LN and quantify its negative effect on scalability. We observe that for micropayments, the forwarding capability of up to 50\% of channels is restricted to a value smaller than the overall channel capacity. This phenomenon not only hinders scalability but also opens the door for DoS attacks: We estimate that a network-wide DoS attack costs within 1.5M USD, while isolating the biggest community from the rest of the network costs only 225k USD.

Our findings should prompt the LN community to consider the security, privacy and scalability issues of the network studied in this work when educating users about path selection algorithms, as well as to adopt multi-hop payment protocols that provide stronger security, privacy and scalability guarantees.},

Multiple block headers are included in batches and verified off-chain, while preserving light client support. Only the validity of the off-chain computation is verified on-chain, creating a sidechain mechanism that requires constant verification costs and releases the target ledger from processing and storing every single block header of the source blockchain. We provide a prototypical implementation that facilitates the verification of 504 Bitcoin headers in a single proof on Ethereum using the ZoKrates framework. Hereby, the verification costs are reduced by a factor of 187 compared to current approaches such as BTC Relay.},

	abstract = {Nakamoto{\textquoteright}s Bitcoin protocol inspired interest in the permissionless regime of distributed computing, in which participants may join and leave an internet-scale protocol execution at will, without needing to register with any authority. The permissionless regime poses challenges to the classical techniques used for consensus protocols, in which participants attempt to agree on a function of their inputs. Crucially, classical consensus techniques require honest participants to remain online and active, and to know an upperbound on the number of participants. Bitcoin addresses this issue by requiring Proof of Work in order to send a message in protocol, and other Bitcoin-inspired works have developed Proof of X variants to remediate the shortcomings of Proof of Work. We propose an abstraction for Proof of X called resources, inspired by how many variants are used in practice. We then show that given few additional assumptions, resources are sufficient to achieve consensus in the permissionless regime. In particular, with appropriate assumptions about resources, it is not necessary to know a bound on the network delay, participants do not need clocks, and participants can join and leave the execution arbitrarily. The core idea is to shift focus from the proportion of honest parties in an execution to the proportion of messages sent by honest parties. We formally model consensus protocols in the permissionless regime, and show how to parameterize a permissionless execution using only the long-term proportion of resources acquired by honest participants and an upperbound on the rate at which resources enter the system, relative to the maximum network delay (without needing to know the network delay). Along the way, we provide a generalized definition of blockchains which we call graph consensus. We present a protocol in the permissionless regime that achieves graph consensus, even when resources enter the system at high rates, but the required honest majority increases with the rate. We show how the protocol can be modified slightly to achieve one-bit consensus. Finally, we show that for every graph consensus protocol that outputs a majority of honest vertices there exists a one-bit consensus protocol.},

	shorttitle = {Proof of {Review} ({PoR})},
	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/475},
	abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical background for a new consensus model called Proof of Review (PoR), which extends Algorand{\textquoteright}s blockchain consensus model and reproduces the human mechanism for analyzing reviews through analysis and reputation. Our protocol derives the trustworthiness of a participant{\textquoteright}s reputation through a consensus of these reviews.

In this new protocol, we combined concepts from proof of stake and proof of reputation to ensure a blockchain system comes to consensus on an honest (non-malicious) congruent review. Additionally, we formally prove this protocol provides further security by using a reputation-based stake instead of token-based, using theorems and proofs. We introduce new concepts in using reputation as a stake, where reputation must be earned and can never be purchased, spent, or traded. The stake is calculated based on the reputation -- not tokens -- of a user in the system proportional to the total reputation in the system at the beginning of each round. A round is a set of steps that conclude in a block being added to the blockchain. We also introduce blacklisting as a decisive action where, after a vote, an honest user will blacklist a leader (the participant elected with their proposed block) or reviewer for some egregious maliciousness, preventing further participation.

Five steps are defined that overlay Algorand{\textquoteright}s steps: (1) Evaluation of reviews; (2) Selection of the round{\textquoteright}s leader and their associated block containing reviews; (3) Re-evaluation of reviews; (4) Block of reviews agreement (block decision); (5) Block addition to the ledger and reputation adjustment. At every step, verifiers are selected randomly for evaluating the reviews and are anonymous to each other. We provided properties related to reputation and formally proved (Honest Leader, Blacklisting Liveliness and Correctness, Evaluation of the Evaluator{\textquoteright}s Confidence, Gradual Gain, and Swift Loss of Reputation). Finally, we discuss several types of attacks that are common for Proof of Stake and Reputation systems, and how our Proof of Review model (in extending Algorand) addresses those attacks. Furthermore, PoR mitigates several kinds of fake reviews (e.g. spam, trolling, etc.) through analysis.

Preliminary experimental results show that payment transactions have similar completion times, regardless of the stake being tokens or reputation, the mechanism for adjusting reputation reflects expected behavior, and the accuracy of the review evaluation (using sentimental analysis) is substantiated for the dataset given. With this new model, we let the technology evaluate a review and secure it on a blockchain using a reputation-based stake.

Proof of Review also provides third party access to reviewer{\textquoteright}s reputation along with their respective evaluated reviews, a functionality that could benefit numerous industries including retail, academia, hospitality, corporate, and more. Applications could expedite and validate many different types of processes that rely on a form of review and the analysis of that review.},

	abstract = {Although blockchains aim for immutability as their core feature, several instances have exposed the harms with perfect immutability. The permanence of illicit content inserted in Bitcoin poses a challenge to law enforcement agencies like Interpol, and millions of dollars are lost in buggy smart contracts in Ethereum. A line of research then spawned on Redactable blockchains with the aim of solving the problem of redacting illicit contents from both permissioned and permissionless blockchains. However, all the existing proposals follow the build-new-chain approach for redactions, and cannot be integrated with existing systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum. We present Reparo, a generic protocol that acts as a publicly verifiable layer on top of any blockchain to perform repairs, ranging from fixing buggy contracts to removing illicit contents from the chain. Reparo facilitates additional functionalities for blockchains while maintaining the same provable security guarantee; thus, Reparo can be integrated with existing blockchains and start performing repairs on the pre-existent data. Any system user may propose a repair and a deliberation process ensues resulting in a decision that complies with the repair policy of the chain and is publicly verifiable. Our Reparo layer can be easily tailored to different consensus requirements, does not require heavy cryptographic machinery and can, therefore, be efficiently instantiated in any permission-ed or -less setting. We demonstrate it by giving efficient instantiations of Reparo on top of Ethereum (with PoS and PoW), Bitcoin, and Cardano. Moreover, we evaluate Reparo with Ethereum mainnet and show that the cost of fixing several prominent smart contract bugs is almost negligible. For instance, the cost of repairing the prominent Parity Multisig wallet bug with Reparo is as low as 0.000000018\% of the Ethers that can be retrieved after the fix.},

We show that in a noncooperative blockchain game (NBG), a Nash equilibrium can be efficiently found in a closed-form even though the game involves more than two players. Somewhat surprisingly, the simulation results of the Nash equilibrium implies that the game can reach a stable status regardless of the number of Byzantine nodes and trustworthy players. We then study a harder problem where players are allowed to form coalitions: the coalitional blockchain game (CBG). We show that although the Shapley value for a CBG can be expressed in a more succinct form, its core is empty.},

It is considered a technological breakthrough anticipated to disrupt several application domains. This has resulted in a plethora of blockchain systems for various purposes. However, many of these blockchain systems suffer from serious shortcomings related to their performance and security, which need to be addressed before any wide-scale adoption can be achieved. A crucial component of any blockchain system is its underlying consensus algorithm, which in many ways, determines its performance and security. Therefore, to address the limitations of different blockchain systems, several existing as well novel consensus algorithms have been introduced. A systematic analysis of these algorithms will help to understand how and why any particular blockchain performs the way it functions. However, the existing studies of consensus algorithms are not comprehensive. Those studies have incomplete discussions on the properties of the algorithms and fail to analyse several major blockchain consensus algorithms in terms of their scopes. This article fills this gap by analysing a wide range of consensus algorithms using a comprehensive taxonomy of properties and by examining the implications of different issues still prevalent in consensus algorithms in detail. The result of the analysis is presented in tabular formats, which provides a visual illustration of these algorithms in a meaningful way. We have also analysed more than hundred top crypto-currencies belonging to different categories of consensus algorithms to understand their properties and to implicate different trends in these crypto-currencies. Finally, we have presented a decision tree of algorithms to be used as a tool to test the suitability of consensus algorithms under different criteria.},

In this work, we revise this popular belief and present CoinPrune, a snapshot-based pruning scheme that is fully compatible with Bitcoin. CoinPrune can be deployed through an opt-in velvet fork, i.e., without impeding the established Bitcoin network. By requiring miners to publicly announce and jointly reaffirm recent snapshots on the blockchain, CoinPrune establishes trust into the snapshots' correctness even in the presence of powerful adversaries. Our evaluation shows that CoinPrune reduces the storage requirements of Bitcoin already by two orders of magnitude today, with further relative savings as the blockchain grows. In our experiments, nodes only have to fetch and process 5 GiB instead of 230 GiB of data when joining the network, reducing the synchronization time on powerful devices from currently 5 h to 46 min, with even more savings for less powerful devices.},

	abstract = {A Distributed Ledger Object (DLO) is a concurrent object that maintains a totally ordered sequence of records, and supports two basic operations: append, which appends a record at the end of the sequence, and get, which returns the sequence of records. In this work we provide a proper formalization of a Byzantine-tolerant Distributed Ledger Object (BDLO), which is a DLO in a distributed system in which processes may deviate arbitrarily from their indented behavior, i.e. they may be Byzantine. Our formal definition is accompanied by algorithms to implement BDLOs by utilizing an underlying Byzantine Atomic Broadcast service. We then utilize the BDLO implementations to solve the Atomic Appends problem against Byzantine processes. The Atomic Appends problem emerges when several clients have records to append, the record of each client has to be appended to a different BDLO, and it must be guaranteed that either all records are appended or none. We present distributed algorithms implementing solutions for the Atomic Appends problem when the clients (which are involved in the appends) and the servers (which maintain the BDLOs) may be Byzantine.},

	abstract = {We improve the fundamental security threshold of eventual consensus Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain protocols under the longest-chain rule by showing, for the first time, the positive effect of rounds with concurrent honest leaders. Current security analyses reduce consistency to the dynamics of an abstract, round-based block creation process that is determined by three events associated with a round: (i) event \$A\$: at least one adversarial leader, (ii) event \$S\$: a single honest leader, and (iii) event \$M\$: multiple, but honest, leaders. We present an asymptotically optimal consistency analysis assuming that an honest round is more likely than an adversarial round (i.e., \${\textbackslash}Pr[S] + {\textbackslash}Pr[M] {\textgreater} {\textbackslash}Pr[A]\$); this threshold is optimal. This is a first in the literature and can be applied to both the simple synchronous communication as well as communication with bounded delays. In all existing consistency analyses, event \$M\$ is either penalized or treated neutrally. Specifically, the consistency analyses in Ouroboros Praos (Eurocrypt 2018) and Genesis (CCS 2018) assume that \${\textbackslash}Pr[S] - {\textbackslash}Pr[M] {\textgreater} {\textbackslash}Pr[A]\$; the analyses in Sleepy Consensus (Asiacrypt 2017) and Snow White (Fin. Crypto 2019) assume that \${\textbackslash}Pr[S] {\textgreater} {\textbackslash}Pr[A]\$. Moreover, all existing analyses completely break down when \${\textbackslash}Pr[S] {\textless} {\textbackslash}Pr[A]\$. These thresholds determine the critical trade-off between the honest majority, network delays, and consistency error. Our new results can be directly applied to improve the security guarantees of the existing protocols. We also complement these results by analyzing the setting where \$S\$ is rare, even allowing \${\textbackslash}Pr[S] = 0\$, under the added assumption that honest players adopt a consistent chain selection rule.},

In this work, we present an adaptive fuzzer for smart contracts on the Ethereum platform called sFuzz. Compared to existing Solidity fuzzers, sFuzz combines the strategy in the AFL fuzzer and an efficient lightweight multi-objective adaptive strategy targeting those hard-to-cover branches. sFuzz has been applied to more than 4 thousand smart contracts and the experimental results show that (1) sFuzz is efficient, e.g., two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art tools; (2) sFuzz is effective in achieving high code coverage and discovering vulnerabilities; and (3) the different fuzzing strategies in sFuzz complement each other.},

Yet, despite their popularity, current blockchain systems exist in isolation, that is, they cannot share information. While interoperability is crucial for blockchain to reach widespread adoption, it is difficult to achieve due to differences among existing blockchain technologies. This paper presents a technique to allow blockchain interoperability. The core idea is to provide a primitive operation to developers so that contracts and objects can switch from one blockchain to another, without breaking consistency and violating key blockchain properties. To validate our ideas, we implemented our protocol in two popular blockchain clients that use the Ethereum virtual machine. We discuss how to build applications using the proposed protocol and show examples of applications based on real use cases that can move across blockchains. To analyze the system performance we use a real trace from one of the most popular Ethereum applications and replay it in a multi-blockchain environment.},

We argue that blockchains can and should be used to implement economic mechanisms because they can help to overcome problems that occur if trust in the mechanism designer cannot be assumed. Mechanism design deals with the allocation of resources to agents, often by extracting private information from them. Some mechanisms are immune to early information disclosure, while others may heavily depend on it. Some mechanisms have to randomize to achieve fairness and efficiency. Both issues, information disclosure, and randomness require trust in the mechanism designer. If there is no trust, mechanisms can be manipulated. We claim that mechanisms that use randomness or sequential information disclosure are much harder, if not impossible, to audit. Therefore, centralized implementation is often not a good solution. We consider some of the most frequently used mechanisms in practice and identify circumstances under which manipulation is possible. We propose a decentralized implementation of such mechanisms, that can be, in practical terms, realized by blockchain technology. Moreover, we argue in which environments a decentralized implementation of a mechanism brings a significant advantage.},

Therefore, it is important to enable developers to discover security vulnerabilities in smart contracts before deployment. A number of static analysis tools have been developed for finding security bugs in smart contracts. However, despite the numerous bug-finding tools, there is no systematic approach to evaluate the proposed tools and gauge their effectiveness. This paper proposes SolidiFI, an automated and systematic approach for evaluating smart contract static analysis tools. SolidiFI is based on injecting bugs (i.e., code defects) into all potential locations in a smart contract to introduce targeted security vulnerabilities. SolidiFI then checks the generated buggy contract using the static analysis tools, and identifies the bugs that the tools are unable to detect (false-negatives) along with identifying the bugs reported as false-positives. SolidiFI is used to evaluate six widely-used static analysis tools, namely, Oyente, Securify, Mythril, SmartCheck, Manticore and Slither, using a set of 50 contracts injected by 9369 distinct bugs. It finds several instances of bugs that are not detected by the evaluated tools despite their claims of being able to detect such bugs, and all the tools report many false positives},

We collect and propose 12 design patterns for blockchain-based self-sovereign identity systems to help the architects understand and easily apply the concepts in system design. Based on the lifecycles of three main objects involved in self-sovereign identity, we categorise the patterns into three groups: key management patterns, decentralised identifier management patterns, and credential design patterns.

	abstract = {The Selfdestruct function is provided by Ethereum smart contracts to destroy a contract on the blockchain system. However, it is a double-edged sword for developers. On the one hand, using Selfdestruct function enables developers to remove smart contracts (SC) from Ethereum and transfers Ethers when emergency situations happen, e.g. being attacked. On the other hand, this function can increase the complexity for the development and open an attack vector for attackers. To better understand the reasons why SC developers include or exclude the Selfdestruct function in their contracts, we conducted an online survey to collect feedback from them and summarize the key reasons. Their feedback shows that 66.67\% of the developers will deploy an updated contract to the Ethereum after destructing the old contract. According to this information, we propose a method to find the self-destruct contracts (also called predecessor contracts) and their updated version (successor contracts) by computing the code similarity. By analyzing the difference between the predecessor contracts and their successor contracts, we found six reasons that led to the death of the contracts; three of them (i.e., Unmatched ERC20 Token, Confusing Contract and Limits of Permission) might affect the life span of contracts. We developed a tool named LifeScope to detect these problems. LifeScope reports 0 false positives or negatives in detecting Unmatched ERC20 Token and Confusing Contract. In terms of Limits of Permission, LifeScope achieves 85.67\% of F-measure and 0.9014 of AUC. According to the feedback of developers who exclude Selfdestruct functions, we propose suggestions to help developers use Selfdestruct functions in Ethereum smart contracts better.},

Blockchain Layer 2 technologies such as the one described in this paper require no such changes. They operate on top of the infrastructure provided by the blockchain platform software.

The overhead is analysed for three scenarios involving multiple blockchains: the Hotel and Train problem, Supply Chain with Provenance, and an Oracle. The protocol is shown to provide 93.8 or 186 cross-blockchain function calls per second for the Hotel and Train scenario when there are many travel agencies, for the standard and scalable variant of the protocol respectively, given the Ethereum client, Hyperledger Besu's performance of 375 tps, assuming a block period of one second, and assuming all transactions take the same amount of time to execute as the benchmark transactions.},

In this paper, we propose a testing framework named Kaya to bridge these gaps. Kaya has three main functions. Firstly, Kaya proposes DApp behavior description language (DBDL) to make writing test cases easier. Test cases written in DBDL can also be automatically executed by Kaya. Secondly, Kaya supports a flexible and convenient way for test engineers to set the blockchain pre-states easily. Thirdly, Kaya transforms incomprehensible addresses into readable variables for easy comprehension. With these functions, Kaya can help test engineers test DApps more easily. Besides, to fit the various application environments, we provide two ways for test engineers to use Kaya, i.e., UI and command-line. Our experimental case demonstrates the potential of Kaya in helping test engineers to test DApps more easily.},

	abstract = {Auditing provides an essential security control in computer systems, by keeping track of all access attempts, including both legitimate and illegal access attempts. This phase can be useful to the context of audits, where eventual misbehaving parties can be held accountable. Blockchain technology can provide trusted auditability required for access control systems. In this paper, we propose a distributed {\textbackslash}ac\{ABAC\} system based on blockchain to provide trusted auditing of access attempts. Besides auditability, our system presents a level of transparency that both access requestors and resource owners can benefit from it. We present a system architecture with an implementation based on Hyperledger Fabric, achieving high efficiency and low computational overhead. The proposed solution is validated through a use case of independent digital libraries. Detailed performance analysis of our implementation is presented, taking into account different consensus mechanisms and databases. The experimental evaluation shows that our presented system can process 5,000 access control requests with the send rate of 200 per second and a latency of 0.3 seconds.},

Evaluating the scheme for Ethereum-based blockchains shows that Testimonium achieves a cost reduction of up to 92\% over existing solutions.

However, much of the work on this topic focuses on the underlying consensus protocols, with emphasis on their lack of scalability, leaving other subtle limitations unaddressed. These limitations are related to the effects of maintaining a durable blockchain instead of a write-ahead log and the requirement for reconfiguring the set of replicas in a decentralized way. We demonstrate these limitations using a digital coin blockchain application and BFT-SMaRt, a popular BFT replication library. We show how they can be addressed both at a conceptual level, in a protocol-agnostic way, and by implementing SMaRtChain, a blockchain platform based on BFT-SMaRt. SMaRtChain improves the performance of our digital coin application by a factor of eight when compared with a naive implementation on top of BFT-SMaRt. Moreover, SMaRtChain achieves a throughput \$8{\textbackslash}times\$ and \$33{\textbackslash}times\$ better than Tendermint and Hyperledger Fabric, respectively, when ensuring strong durability on its blockchain.},

The Base Model is usable for a wide variety of blockchain systems and can be extended easily to include system or deployment particulars. The BlockSim software tool provides a simulator that implements the Base Model in Python. This paper describes the Base Model, the simulator implementation, and the application of BlockSim to Bitcoin, Ethereum and other consensus algorithms. We validate BlockSim simulation results by comparison with performance results from actual systems and from other studies in the literature. We close the paper by a BlockSim simulation study of the impact of uncle blocks rewards on mining decentralization, for a variety of blockchain configurations.},

	shorttitle = {{AuthSC}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14033},
	abstract = {Although almost all information about Smart Contract addresses is shared via websites, emails, or other forms of digital communication, Blockchains and distributed ledger technology are unable to establish secure bindings between websites and corresponding Smart Contracts. For a user, it is impossible to differentiate whether a website links to a legitimate Smart Contract set up by owners of a business or to an illicit contract aiming to steal users' funds. Surprisingly, current attempts to solve this issue mostly comprise of information redundancy, e.g., displaying contract addresses multiple times in varying forms of images and texts. These processes are burdensome, as the user is responsible for verifying the correctness of an address. More importantly, they do not address the core issue, as the contract itself does not contain information about its authenticity. To solve current issues for these applications and increase security, we propose a solution that facilitates publicly issued SSL/TLS-certificates of Fully-Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) to ensure the authenticity of Smart Contracts and their owners. Our approach combines on-chain identity assertion utilizing signatures from the respective certificate and off-chain authentication of the Smart Contract stored on the Blockchain. This approach allows to tackle the aforementioned issue and further enables applications such as the identification of consortia members in permissioned networks. The system is open and transparent, as the only requirement for usage is ownership of an SSL/TLS-certificate. To enable privacy-preserving authenticated Smart Contracts, we allow one-way and two-way binding between website and contract. Further, low creation and maintenance costs, a widely accepted public key infrastructure and user empowerment will drive potential adaption of Ethereum Authenticated Smart Contracts (AuthSC).},

	abstract = {Ethereum has emerged as the most popular smart contract development platform, with hundreds of thousands of contracts stored on the blockchain and covering a variety of application scenarios, such as auctions, trading platforms, and so on. Given their financial nature, security vulnerabilities may lead to catastrophic consequences and, even worse, they can be hardly fixed as data stored on the blockchain, including the smart contract code itself, are immutable. An automated security analysis of these contracts is thus of utmost interest, but at the same time technically challenging for a variety of reasons, such as the specific transaction-oriented programming mechanisms, which feature a subtle semantics, and the fact that the blockchain data which the contract under analysis interacts with, including the code of callers and callees, are not statically known. In this work, we present eThor, the first sound and automated static analyzer for EVM bytecode, which is based on an abstraction of the EVM bytecode semantics based on Horn clauses. In particular, our static analysis supports reachability properties, which we show to be sufficient for capturing interesting security properties for smart contracts (e.g., single-entrancy) as well as contract-specific functional properties. Our analysis is proven sound against a complete semantics of EVM bytecode and an experimental large-scale evaluation on real-world contracts demonstrates that eThor is practical and outperforms the state-of-the-art static analyzers: specifically, eThor is the only one to provide soundness guarantees, terminates on 95\% of a representative set of real-world contracts, and achieves an F-measure (which combines sensitivity and specificity) of 89\%.},

	abstract = {As one of the representative blockchain platforms, Ethereum has attracted lots of attacks. Due to the potential financial loss, there is a pressing need to detect malicious smart contracts and understand their behaviors. Though there exist multiple systems for smart contract analysis, they cannot efficiently analyze a large number of transactions and re-execute smart contracts to introspect malicious behaviors. In this paper, we urge for a transaction-centric security analytics framework for Ethereum, which provides an efficient way to quickly locate suspicious ones from a large number of transactions and extensible way to detect malicious smart contracts with analyst-provided scripts. We present the system design in the paper, which solves three technical challenges, i.e., incomplete states, scalability and extensibility. We have implemented a prototype system named EthScope to solve these challenges. In particular, the first component Data Aggregator collects and recovers critical blockchain states. The second component Replay Engine is able to \{replay\} arbitrary and a large number of transactions. The third component Instrumentation Framework exposes interfaces for an analyst to dynamically instrument smart contracts and introspect the execution of suspicious transactions. The comprehensive evaluation with six types of attacks demonstrated the effectiveness of our system. The performance evaluation shows that our system can perform a large-scale analysis on suspicious transactions (more than 8 million ones) and has a speed up of around 2,300x compared with the JSTracer provided by Go-Ethereum. To engage the community, we will release our system and a dataset of detected attacks on https://github.com/zjuicsr/ethscope.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12156},
	abstract = {Smart contracts are Turing-complete programs that are executed across a blockchain network. Unlike traditional programs, once deployed they cannot be modified. As smart contracts become more popular and carry more value, they become more of an interesting target for attackers. In recent years, smart contracts suffered major exploits, costing millions of dollars, due to programming errors. As a result, a variety of tools for detecting bugs has been proposed. However, majority of these tools often yield many false positives due to over-approximation or poor code coverage due to complex path constraints. Fuzzing or fuzz testing is a popular and effective software testing technique. However, traditional fuzzers tend to be more effective towards finding shallow bugs and less effective in finding bugs that lie deeper in the execution. In this work, we present CONFUZZIUS, a hybrid fuzzer that combines evolutionary fuzzing with constraint solving in order to execute more code and find more bugs in smart contracts. Evolutionary fuzzing is used to exercise shallow parts of a smart contract, while constraint solving is used to generate inputs which satisfy complex conditions that prevent the evolutionary fuzzing from exploring deeper paths. Moreover, we use data dependency analysis to efficiently generate sequences of transactions, that create specific contract states in which bugs may be hidden. We evaluate the effectiveness of our fuzzing strategy, by comparing CONFUZZIUS with state-of-the-art symbolic execution tools and fuzzers. Our evaluation shows that our hybrid fuzzing approach produces significantly better results than state-of-the-art symbolic execution tools and fuzzers.},

	abstract = {Proof-of-Work{\textasciitilde}(PoW) based blockchains typically allocate only a tiny fraction (e.g., less than 1\% for Ethereum) of the average interarrival time{\textasciitilde}(\${\textbackslash}mathbb\{I\}\$) between blocks for validating transactions. A trivial increase in validation time{\textasciitilde}(\${\textbackslash}tau\$) introduces the popularly known Verifier's Dilemma, and as we demonstrate, causes more forking and increases unfairness. Large \${\textbackslash}tau\$ also reduces the tolerance for safety against a Byzantine adversary. Solutions that offload validation to a set of non-chain nodes (a.k.a. off-chain approaches) suffer from trust issues that are non-trivial to resolve. In this paper, we present Tuxedo, the first on-chain protocol to theoretically scale \${\textbackslash}tau/{\textbackslash}mathbb\{I\} {\textbackslash}approx 1\$ in PoW blockchains. The key innovation in Tuxedo is to separate the consensus on the ordering of transactions from their execution. We achieve this by allowing miners to delay validation of transactions in a block by up to \${\textbackslash}zeta\$ blocks, where \${\textbackslash}zeta\$ is a system parameter. We perform security analysis of Tuxedo considering all possible adversarial strategies in a synchronous network with end-to-end delay \${\textbackslash}Delta\$ and demonstrate that Tuxedo achieves security equivalent to known results for longest chain PoW Nakamoto consensus. Additionally, we also suggest a principled approach for practical choices of parameter \${\textbackslash}zeta\$ as per the application requirement. Our prototype implementation of Tuxedo atop Ethereum demonstrates that it can scale \${\textbackslash}tau\$ without suffering the harmful effects of naive scaling in existing blockchains.},

From those 332 documents, we systematically analyzed and discussed 80 documents, including both peer-reviewed papers and grey literature. Our review classifies studies in three categories: Cryptocurrency-directed interoperability approaches, Blockchain Engines, and Blockchain Connectors. Each category is further divided into sub-categories based on defined criteria. We discuss not only studies within each category and subcategory but also across categories, providing a holistic overview of blockchain interoperability, paving the way for systematic research in this domain. Our findings show that blockchain interoperability has a much broader spectrum than cryptocurrencies. The present survey leverages an interesting approach: we systematically contacted the authors of grey literature papers and industry solutions to obtain an updated view of their work.

	shorttitle = {{GHAST}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01072},
	abstract = {Initiated from Nakamoto's Bitcoin system, blockchain technology has demonstrated great capability of building secure consensus among decentralized parties at Internet-scale, i.e., without relying on any centralized trusted party. Nowadays, blockchain systems find applications in various fields. But the performance is increasingly becoming a bottleneck, especially when permissionless participation is retained for full decentralization. In this work, we present a new consensus protocol named GHAST (Greedy Heaviest Adaptive Sub-Tree) which organizes blocks in a Tree-Graph structure (i.e., a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a tree embedded) that allows fast and concurrent block generation. GHAST protocol simultaneously achieves a logarithmically bounded liveness guarantee and low confirmation latency. More specifically, for maximum latency \$d\$ and adversarial computing power bounded away from 50{\textbackslash}\%, GHAST guarantees confirmation with confidence \${\textbackslash}ge 1-{\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ after a time period of \$O(d{\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}log(1/{\textbackslash}varepsilon))\$. When there is no observable attack, GHAST only needs \$3d\$ time to achieve confirmation at the same confidence level as six-block-confirmation in Bitcoin, while it takes roughly \$360d\$ in Bitcoin.},

	abstract = {In standard voting procedures, random audits are one method for increasing election integrity. In the case of cryptographic (or end-to-end) election verification, random challenges are often used to establish that the tally was computed correctly. In both cases, a source of randomness is required. In two recent binding cryptographic elections, this randomness was drawn from stock market data. This approach allows anyone with access to financial data to verify the challenges were generated correctly and, assuming market fluctuations are unpredictable to some degree, the challenges were generated at the correct time. However the degree to which these fluctuations are unpredictable is not known to be sufficient for generating a fair and unpredictable challenge. In this paper, we use tools from computational finance to provide an estimate of the amount of entropy in the closing price of a stock. We estimate that for each of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average, the entropy is between 6 and 9 bits per trading day. We then propose a straight-forward protocol for regularly publishing verifiable 128-bit random seeds with entropy harvested over time from stock prices. These {\textquotedblleft}beacons{\textquotedblright} can be used as challenges directly, or as a seed to a deterministic pseudorandom generator for creating larger challenges.},

As a side-effect of Bitcoin's proof-of-work-based consensus system, random values are broadcast every time new blocks are mined. We can derive strong lower bounds on the computational min-entropy in each block: currently, at least 68 bits of min-entropy are produced every 10 minutes, from which one can derive over 32 near-uniform bits using standard extractor techniques. We show that any attack on this beacon would form an attack on Bitcoin itself and hence have a monetary cost that we can bound, unlike any other construction for a public randomness beacon in the literature. In our simplest construction, we show that a lottery producing a single unbiased bit is manipulation-resistant against an attacker with a stake of less than 50 bitcoins in the output, or about US\$12,000 today. Finally, we propose making the beacon output available to smart contracts and demonstrate that this simple tool enables a number of interesting applications.},

We show that \${\textbackslash}pi\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{beacon\}\}\$ can be instantiated via Bitcoin under sensible assumptions; in particular we consider an adversary with an arbitrarily large initial budget who may not operate at a loss indefinitely. In case the adversary has an infinite budget, we provide an impossibility result that stems from the similarity between the Bitcoin model and Santha-Vazirani sources. We also give a hybrid protocol that combines trusted parties and a Bitcoin-based beacon.},

	abstract = {Uniform randomness beacons whose output can be publicly attested to be unbiased are required in several cryptographic protocols. A common approach to building such beacons is having a number parties run a coin tossing protocol with guaranteed output delivery (so that adversaries cannot simply keep honest parties from obtaining randomness, consequently halting protocols that rely on it). However, current constructions face serious scalability issues due to high computational and communication overheads. We present a coin tossing protocol for an honest majority that allows for any entity to verify that an output was honestly generated by observing publicly available information (even after the execution is complete), while achieving both guaranteed output delivery and scalability. The main building block of our construction is the first Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing scheme for threshold access structures that requires only O(n) exponentiations. Previous schemes required O(nt) exponentiations (where t is the threshold) from each of the parties involved, making them unfit for scalable distributed randomness generation, which requires t=n/2 and thus O(n{\textasciicircum}2) exponentiations.},

	abstract = {A reliable source of randomness is not only an essential building block in various cryptographic, security, and distributed systems protocols, but also plays an integral part in the design of many new blockchain proposals. Consequently, the topic of publicly-verifiable, bias-resistant and unpredictable randomness has recently enjoyed increased attention. In particular random beacon protocols, aimed at continuous operation, can be a vital component for current Proof-of-Stake based distributed ledger proposals. We improve upon previous random beacon approaches with HydRand, a novel distributed protocol based on publicly-verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) to ensure unpredictability, bias-resistance, and public-verifiability of a continuous sequence of random beacon values. Furthermore, HydRand provides guaranteed output delivery of randomness at regular and predictable intervals in the presence of adversarial behavior and does not rely on a trusted dealer for the initial setup. Compared to existing PVSS based approaches that strive to achieve similar properties, our solution improves scalability by lowering the communication complexity from O(n3) to O(n2). Furthermore, we are the first to present a detailed comparison of recently described schemes and protocols that can be used for implementing random beacons.},

	abstract = {Blockchains generated using a proofof-work consensus protocol, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, are promising sources of public randomness. However, the randomness is subject to manipulation by the miners generating the blockchain. A general defense is to apply a delay function, preventing malicious miners from computing the random output until it is too late to manipulate it. Ideally, this delay function can provide a short proofof-delay that is efficient enough to be verified within a smart contract, enabling the randomness source to be directly by smart contracts. In this paper we describe the challenges of solving this problem given the extremely limited computational capacity available in Ethereum, the most popular generalpurpose smart contract framework to date. We introduce a novel multi-round protocol for verifying delay functions using a refereed delegation model. We provide a prototype Ethereum implementation to analyze performance and find that it is feasible in terms of gas costs, costing roughly 180000 gas (US\$ 0.111) to post a beacon and 720000 gas (US\$ 0.98) to resolve a dispute . We also discuss the incentive challenges raised by providing a secure randomness beacon as a public good.},

While leader election is a well studied problem, the rise of distributed ledgers (i.e., blockchains) has led to a new perspective on how to perform large-scale leader elections via solving a computationally difficult puzzle (i.e., proof of work). In this paper, we present Caucus, a large-scale leader election protocol with minimal coordination costs that does not require the computational cost of proof-of-work. We evaluate Caucus in terms of its security, using a new model for blockchain-focused leader election, before testing an implementation of Caucus on an Ethereum private network. Our experiments highlight that one variant of Caucus costs only \$0.10 per leader election if deployed on Ethereum.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of providing blockchain applications with {\textbackslash}emph\{economically viable randomness\} (EVR), namely, randomness that has significant economic consequences. Applications of EVR include blockchain-based lotteries and gambling. An EVR source guarantees (i) secrecy, assuring that the random bits are kept secret until some predefined condition indicates that they are safe to reveal (e.g., the lottery's ticket sale closes), and (ii) robustness, guaranteeing that the random bits are published once the condition holds. We formalize the EVR problem and solve it on top of an Ethereum-like blockchain abstraction, which supports smart contracts and a transferable native coin. Randomness is generated via a distributed open commit-reveal scheme by game-theoretic agents who strive to maximize their coin holdings. Note that in an economic setting, such agents might profit from breaking secrecy or robustness, and may engage in side agreements (via smart contracts) to this end. Our solution creates an incentive structure that counters such attacks. We prove that following the protocol gives rise to a stable state, called Coalition-Proof Nash Equilibrium, from which no coalition comprised of a subset of the players can agree to deviate. In this stable state, robustness and secrecy are satisfied. Finally, we implement our EVR source over Ethereum.},
