	abstract = {The CAP theorem says that no blockchain can be live under dynamic participation and safe under temporary network partitions. To resolve this availability-finality dilemma, we formulate a new class of flexible consensus protocols, ebb-and-flow protocols, which support a full dynamically available ledger in conjunction with a finalized prefix ledger. The finalized ledger falls behind the full ledger when the network partitions but catches up when the network heals. Gasper, the current candidate protocol for Ethereum 2.0's beacon chain, combines the finality gadget Casper FFG with the LMD GHOST fork choice rule and aims to achieve this property. However, we discovered an attack in the standard synchronous network model, highlighting a general difficulty with existing finality-gadget-based designs. We present a construction of provably secure ebb-and-flow protocols with optimal resilience. Nodes run an off-the-shelf dynamically available protocol, take snapshots of the growing available ledger, and input them into a separate off-the-shelf BFT protocol to finalize a prefix. We explore connections with flexible BFT and improve upon the state-of-the-art for that problem.},

	abstract = {Blockchains are intended to be immutable, so an attacker who is able to delete transactions through a chain reorganization (a malicious reorg) can perform a profitable double-spend attack. We study the rate at which an attacker can execute reorgs in the Tezos Proof-of-Stake protocol. As an example, an attacker with 40\% of the staking power is able to execute a 20-block malicious reorg at an average rate of once per day, and the attack probability increases super-linearly as the staking power grows beyond 40\%. Moreover, an attacker of the Tezos protocol knows in advance when an attack opportunity will arise, and can use this knowledge to arrange transactions to double-spend. We show that in particular cases, the Tezos protocol can be adjusted to protect against deep reorgs. For instance, we demonstrate protocol parameters that reduce the rate of length-20 reorg opportunities for a 40\% attacker by two orders of magnitude. We also observe a trade-off between optimizing for robustness to deep reorgs (costly deviations that may be net profitable because they enable double-spends) and robustness to selfish mining (mining deviations that result in typically short reorgs that are profitable even without double-spends). That is, the parameters that optimally protect against one make the other attack easy. Finally, we develop a method that monitors the Tezos blockchain health with respect to malicious reorgs using only publicly available information.},

	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1098},
	abstract = {Bitcoin has introduced an open and decentralized consensus mechanism which in combination with an append-only ledger allows building so-called blockchain systems, often instantiated as permissionless cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is surprisingly successful and its market capitalization has reached about 168 billion USD as of July 2020. Due to its high economic value, it became a lucrative target and the growing community has discovered various attacks, proposed promising improvements, and introduced contingency plans for handling catastrophic failures. Nonetheless, existing analysis and contingency plans are not formalized and are tailored only to handle a small specific subset of diverse attacks, and as such, they cannot resist unexpected emergency cases and it is hard to reason about their effectiveness and impact on the system. In this work, we provide a formalized framework to help evaluate a variety of attacks and their mitigations. The framework is based upon the universal composability (UC) framework to describe the attacker's power and the system's security goals. We propose the system in the context of Bitcoin and to the best of our knowledge, no similar work has been proposed previously. Besides, we demonstrate and evaluate our model with different case studies from the real world. Finally, we signal remaining challenges for the contingency plans and their formalization.},

	abstract = {First implemented in Bitcoin, Nakamoto Consensus (NC) is the most influential consensus protocol in cryptocurrencies despite all the alternative protocols designed afterward. Nevertheless, NC is trapped with a security-performance tradeoff, largely limiting the latter. In this paper, we propose NC-Max, a consensus protocol that breaks the throughput limit and enables the full utilization of the nodes' bandwidth in confirming transactions. In particular, after identifying the mechanism through which NC's security limits its performance, we decouple transaction synchronization from confirmation with a two-step mechanism, relieving the limits on the block size and the block interval. Further, we introduce an accurate dynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism to explore the real-time network condition and to adjust the protocol's throughput accordingly. We analyze the security of NC-Max, proving that it resists selfish mining and transaction withholding attacks better than NC does. Our performance evaluation shows that NC-Max not only fully exploits the nodes' bandwidth to confirm transactions, but also shortens the overall transaction confirmation latency by at least a factor of four compared to NC without compromising security.},

In this paper we propose a game theoretical framework in order to formally characterize the robustness of blockchains systems in terms of resilience to rational deviations and immunity to Byzantine behaviors. Our framework includes necessary and sufficient conditions for checking the immunity and resilience of games and a new technique for composing games that preserves the robustness of individual games. We prove the practical interest of our formal framework by characterizing the robustness of three different protocols popular in blockchain systems: a HTLC-based payment scheme (a.k.a. Lightning Network), a side-chain protocol and a cross-chain swap protocol.},

	abstract = {Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) have been a promising approach to scale blockchains. However, PCNs lack liquidity, as large-amount or multi-hop payments may fail. Payment griefing is one of the identified attacks on PCNs{\textquoteright} liquidity, where the payee withholds the preimage in Hash Time Locked Contract. Before this payment expires, coins involved in this payment cannot be used in other payments. We introduce Bankrun attack, which exploits payment griefing to bank run PCNs. Bankrun in finance means numerous clients withdraw their money from a bank, which makes the bank insolvent and even bankrupted. In our Bankrun attack, the attacker generates sybil nodes, establishes channels with hubs in the network, makes payments between his nodes and griefs them simultaneously. If the adversary has sufficient coins, he can lock a high percentage of coins in the PCN, so that the PCN may no longer handle normal payments. We introduce a framework for launching Bankrun attacks, and develop three strategies with a focus on minimising the cost, draining important channels, and locking most amount of coins, respectively. We evaluate the effectiveness of Bankrun attacks on Bitcoin{\textquoteright}s Lightning Network, the first and most well-known PCN. Our evaluation results show that, using channels with 1.5\% richest nodes, the attacker can lock 83\% of the capacity in the entire network. With connections to these nodes, an adversary with 13\% (77 BTC) of coins in the network can lock up to 45\% (267 BTC) of coins in the entire network until time out (e.g. for an entire day); reduces the success rate of payments by 23.8\%62.7\%; increases fee of payments by 3.5\%14.0\%; and increases average attempts of payments by 26.4\%113.7\%, where payments range from 100,000 to 1,900,000 satoshi (7135 USD).},

	abstract = {Game theory is often used as a tool to analyze decentralized systems and their properties, in particular, blockchains. In this note, we take the opposite view. We argue that blockchains can and should be used to implement economic mechanisms because they can help to overcome problems that occur if trust in the mechanism designer cannot be assumed. Mechanism design deals with the allocation of resources to agents, often by extracting private information from them. Some mechanisms are immune to early information disclosure, while others may heavily depend on it. Some mechanisms have to randomize to achieve fairness and efficiency. Both issues, information disclosure, and randomness require trust in the mechanism designer. If there is no trust, mechanisms can be manipulated. We claim that mechanisms that use randomness or sequential information disclosure are much harder, if not impossible, to audit. Therefore, centralized implementation is often not a good solution. We consider some of the most frequently used mechanisms in practice and identify circumstances under which manipulation is possible. We propose a decentralized implementation of such mechanisms, that can be, in practical terms, realized by blockchain technology. Moreover, we argue in which environments a decentralized implementation of a mechanism brings a significant advantage.},

	abstract = {A fundamental conflict of many proof-of-work systems is that they want to achieve inclusiveness and security at the same time. We analyze and resolve this conflict with a theory of proof-of-work quorums, which enables a new bridge between Byzantine and Nakamoto consensus. The theory yields stochastic uniqueness of quorums as a function of a security parameter. We employ the theory in HotPoW, a scalable permissionless distributed log protocol that supports finality based on the pipelined three-phase commit previously presented for HotStuff. We evaluate HotPoW and variants with adversarial modifications by simulation. Results show that the protocol can tolerate network latency, churn, and targeted attacks on consistency and liveness with a small storage overhead compared to plain Nakamoto consensus and less complexity than protocols that rely on sidechains for finality.},

At present, a vast number of blockchain projects have been introduced and employed with various features that are not necessarily designed to work with each other. This makes it difficult for users to utilise a large number of applications on different blockchain projects. Moreover, with the increase in number of projects the security that each one is providing individually becomes weaker. Polkadot aims to provide a scalable and interoperable framework for multiple chains with pooled security that is achieved by the collection of components described in this paper.},

It works in addition to a block production mechanism and a chain selection rule, that on their own would only provide eventual consensus. The design of GRANDPA aims at separating these two protocols as cleanly as possible and obtain formal guarantees for the finality gadget. GRANDPA attempts to finalise the prefix of the chain that \$2/3\$ of voters agree on, whether that is one or thousands blocks. It has been implemented by Parity Technologies and deployed on large testnets for the Polkadot protocol. We also present properties GRANDPA achieves and review GRANDPA's advantages in flexibility over comparable protocols.},

However, the proliferation of blockchain technology has led to the need of supporting transactions across multiple networks requiring interoperability. Thus far, minimal analysis has been dedicated to the interoperability scenario and in particular the prevention of double spending attacks across interoperable blockchain networks. In this paper, we propose the use of neutral observers to monitor transactions that span multiple blockchains and design a protocol that obviates the double spending problem across interoperable blockchain networks. We show that the observers, can detect double spending, while remaining honest to the protocol as it is more profitable to them than colluding due to our proposed disincentivization scheme. Leveraging Ethereum's smart-contract functionality, we simulate our proposed disincentivization scheme and show its cost-effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Blockchains generated using a proofof-work consensus protocol, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, are promising sources of public randomness. However, the randomness is subject to manipulation by the miners generating the blockchain. A general defense is to apply a delay function, preventing malicious miners from computing the random output until it is too late to manipulate it. Ideally, this delay function can provide a short proofof-delay that is efficient enough to be verified within a smart contract, enabling the randomness source to be directly by smart contracts. In this paper we describe the challenges of solving this problem given the extremely limited computational capacity available in Ethereum, the most popular generalpurpose smart contract framework to date. We introduce a novel multi-round protocol for verifying delay functions using a refereed delegation model. We provide a prototype Ethereum implementation to analyze performance and find that it is feasible in terms of gas costs, costing roughly 180000 gas (US\$ 0.111) to post a beacon and 720000 gas (US\$ 0.98) to resolve a dispute . We also discuss the incentive challenges raised by providing a secure randomness beacon as a public good.},

	abstract = {In standard voting procedures, random audits are one method for increasing election integrity. In the case of cryptographic (or end-to-end) election verification, random challenges are often used to establish that the tally was computed correctly. In both cases, a source of randomness is required. In two recent binding cryptographic elections, this randomness was drawn from stock market data. This approach allows anyone with access to financial data to verify the challenges were generated correctly and, assuming market fluctuations are unpredictable to some degree, the challenges were generated at the correct time. However the degree to which these fluctuations are unpredictable is not known to be sufficient for generating a fair and unpredictable challenge. In this paper, we use tools from computational finance to provide an estimate of the amount of entropy in the closing price of a stock. We estimate that for each of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average, the entropy is between 6 and 9 bits per trading day. We then propose a straight-forward protocol for regularly publishing verifiable 128-bit random seeds with entropy harvested over time from stock prices. These {\textquotedblleft}beacons{\textquotedblright} can be used as challenges directly, or as a seed to a deterministic pseudorandom generator for creating larger challenges.},

	abstract = {A reliable source of randomness is not only an essential building block in various cryptographic, security, and distributed systems protocols, but also plays an integral part in the design of many new blockchain proposals. Consequently, the topic of publicly-verifiable, bias-resistant and unpredictable randomness has recently enjoyed increased attention. In particular random beacon protocols, aimed at continuous operation, can be a vital component for current Proof-of-Stake based distributed ledger proposals. We improve upon previous random beacon approaches with HydRand, a novel distributed protocol based on publicly-verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) to ensure unpredictability, bias-resistance, and public-verifiability of a continuous sequence of random beacon values. Furthermore, HydRand provides guaranteed output delivery of randomness at regular and predictable intervals in the presence of adversarial behavior and does not rely on a trusted dealer for the initial setup. Compared to existing PVSS based approaches that strive to achieve similar properties, our solution improves scalability by lowering the communication complexity from O(n3) to O(n2). Furthermore, we are the first to present a detailed comparison of recently described schemes and protocols that can be used for implementing random beacons.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of providing blockchain applications with {\textbackslash}emph\{economically viable randomness\} (EVR), namely, randomness that has significant economic consequences. Applications of EVR include blockchain-based lotteries and gambling. An EVR source guarantees (i) secrecy, assuring that the random bits are kept secret until some predefined condition indicates that they are safe to reveal (e.g., the lottery's ticket sale closes), and (ii) robustness, guaranteeing that the random bits are published once the condition holds. We formalize the EVR problem and solve it on top of an Ethereum-like blockchain abstraction, which supports smart contracts and a transferable native coin. Randomness is generated via a distributed open commit-reveal scheme by game-theoretic agents who strive to maximize their coin holdings. Note that in an economic setting, such agents might profit from breaking secrecy or robustness, and may engage in side agreements (via smart contracts) to this end. Our solution creates an incentive structure that counters such attacks. We prove that following the protocol gives rise to a stable state, called Coalition-Proof Nash Equilibrium, from which no coalition comprised of a subset of the players can agree to deviate. In this stable state, robustness and secrecy are satisfied. Finally, we implement our EVR source over Ethereum.},

As a side-effect of Bitcoin's proof-of-work-based consensus system, random values are broadcast every time new blocks are mined. We can derive strong lower bounds on the computational min-entropy in each block: currently, at least 68 bits of min-entropy are produced every 10 minutes, from which one can derive over 32 near-uniform bits using standard extractor techniques. We show that any attack on this beacon would form an attack on Bitcoin itself and hence have a monetary cost that we can bound, unlike any other construction for a public randomness beacon in the literature. In our simplest construction, we show that a lottery producing a single unbiased bit is manipulation-resistant against an attacker with a stake of less than 50 bitcoins in the output, or about US\$12,000 today. Finally, we propose making the beacon output available to smart contracts and demonstrate that this simple tool enables a number of interesting applications.},

	abstract = {Uniform randomness beacons whose output can be publicly attested to be unbiased are required in several cryptographic protocols. A common approach to building such beacons is having a number parties run a coin tossing protocol with guaranteed output delivery (so that adversaries cannot simply keep honest parties from obtaining randomness, consequently halting protocols that rely on it). However, current constructions face serious scalability issues due to high computational and communication overheads. We present a coin tossing protocol for an honest majority that allows for any entity to verify that an output was honestly generated by observing publicly available information (even after the execution is complete), while achieving both guaranteed output delivery and scalability. The main building block of our construction is the first Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing scheme for threshold access structures that requires only O(n) exponentiations. Previous schemes required O(nt) exponentiations (where t is the threshold) from each of the parties involved, making them unfit for scalable distributed randomness generation, which requires t=n/2 and thus O(n{\textasciicircum}2) exponentiations.},

Yet, it has remained a partially open question: how robust are such protocols? We consider a natural extension of the random phone-call model (introduced by Karp et al. [1]), and we analyze two different notions of robustness: the ability to tolerate adaptive failures, and the ability to tolerate oblivious failures.For adaptive failures, we present a new gossip protocol, TrickleGossip, which achieves near-optimal O(n log3 n) message complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first epidemic-style protocol that can tolerate adaptive failures. We also show a direct relation between resilience and message complexity, demonstrating that gossip protocols which tolerate a large number of adaptive failures need to use a super-linear number of messages with high probability.For oblivious failures, we present a new gossip protocol, CoordinatedGossip, that achieves optimal O(n) message complexity. This protocol makes novel use of the universe reduction technique to limit the message complexity.},

	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1033.pdf},
	abstract = {Decentralised Randomness Beacon (DRB) is a service that generates publicly verifiable randomness. Constructing DRB protocols is challenging. Existing DRB protocols suffer from either strong network synchrony assumptions, high communication complexity or various attacks. In this paper, we propose RandChain, a new family of DRB protocols. To construct RandChain, we first construct Sequential Proof-of-Work (SeqPoW), a Proof-of-Work (PoW) variant that is sequential, i.e., the work can only be done by a single processor. In RandChain, nodes jointly maintain a blockchain, i.e., a chain of blocks, and each block derives a random output. Each node derives a unique SeqPoW puzzle from the last block and its identity, and keeps mining, i.e., solving the SeqPoW puzzle, to append a block to the blockchain. This makes mining non-parallelisable. RandChain applies Nakamoto consensus so that nodes agree on a unique blockchain. While inheriting simplicity and scalability from Nakamoto consensus, RandChain produces strongly unpredictable randomness and remains energy-efficient and decentralised. RandChain does not allow nodes to input local entropy, thus giving no opportunity to bias randomness. Solutions of SeqPoW puzzles are unpredictable, so nodes cannot predict randomness. As each node can use at most a single processor for mining, RandChain remains energy-efficient. SeqPoW mining can only be accelerated by increasing processors{\textquoteright} clock rate, which is bound by processors{\textquoteright} voltage limit. Therefore, powerful nodes can only achieve limited speedup compared to normal nodes, leading to a high degree of mining power decentralisation.},

We answer the question in the affirmative for three classes of longest chain protocols, designed for different consensus models: 1) Nakamoto's original Proof-of-Work protocol; 2) Ouroboros and SnowWhite Proof-of-Stake protocols; 3) Chia Proof-of-Space protocol. As a consequence, exact characterization of the maximum tolerable adversary power is obtained for each protocol as a function of the average block time normalized by the network delay. The security analysis of these protocols is performed in a unified manner by a novel method of reducing all attacks to a race between the adversary and the honest nodes.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08099},
	abstract = {The Global Financial Crisis of 2008, caused by the accumulation of excessive financial risk, inspired Satoshi Nakamoto to create Bitcoin. Now, more than ten years later, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a peer-to-peer financial paradigm which leverages blockchain-based smart contracts to ensure its integrity and security, contains over 702m USD of capital as of April 15th, 2020. As this ecosystem develops, it is at risk of the very sort of financial meltdown it is supposed to be preventing. In this paper we explore how design weaknesses and price fluctuations in DeFi protocols could lead to a DeFi crisis. We focus on DeFi lending protocols as they currently constitute most of the DeFi ecosystem with a 76\% market share by capital as of April 15th, 2020. First, we demonstrate the feasibility of attacking Maker's governance design to take full control of the protocol, the largest DeFi protocol by market share, which would have allowed the theft of 0.5bn USD of collateral and the minting of an unlimited supply of DAI tokens. In doing so, we present a novel strategy utilizing so-called flash loans that would have in principle allowed the execution of the governance attack in just two transactions and without the need to lock any assets. Approximately two weeks after we disclosed the attack details, Maker modified the governance parameters mitigating the attack vectors. Second, we turn to a central component of financial risk in DeFi lending protocols. Inspired by stress-testing as performed by central banks, we develop a stress-testing framework for a stylized DeFi lending protocol, focusing our attention on the impact of a drying-up of liquidity on protocol solvency. Based on our parameters, we find that with sufficiently illiquidity a lending protocol with a total debt of 400m USD could become undercollateralized within 19 days.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07497},
	abstract = {Proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency blockchains like Bitcoin secure vast amounts of money. Their operators, called miners, expend resources to generate blocks and receive monetary rewards for their effort. Blockchains are, in principle, attractive targets for Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks: There is fierce competition among coins, as well as potential gains from short selling. Classical DoS attacks, however, typically target a few servers and cannot scale to systems with many nodes. There have been no successful DoS attacks to date against prominent cryptocurrencies. We present Blockchain DoS (BDoS), the first incentive-based DoS attack that targets PoW cryptocurrencies. Unlike classical DoS, BDoS targets the system's mechanism design: It exploits the reward mechanism to discourage miner participation. Previous DoS attacks against PoW blockchains require an adversary's mining power to match that of all other miners. In contrast, BDoS can cause a blockchain to grind to a halt with significantly less resources, e.g., 17\% as of Feb 2019 in Bitcoin according to our empirical study. BDoS differs from known attacks like Selfish Mining in its aim not to increase an adversary's revenue, but to disrupt the system. Although it bears some algorithmic similarity to those attacks, it introduces a new adversarial model, goals, algorithm, and game-theoretic analysis. Beyond its direct implications for operational blockchains, BDoS introduces the novel idea that an adversary can manipulate miners' incentives by proving the existence of a secret longest chain without actually publishing blocks.},

Their basic properties---consistency and liveness---can be guaranteed under specific constraints about the resources of an adversary relative to the resources of the nodes that follow the protocol. Given the intended long-livedness of these protocols, perhaps the most fundamental open security question currently is their behavior and potential resilience to temporary spikes in adversarial resources.

In this work we give the first thorough treatment of self-healing properties of distributed ledgers covering both proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols. Our results quantify the vulnerability period that corresponds to an adversarial spike and classify three types of currently deployed protocols with respect to their self-healing ability: PoW-based blockchains, PoS-based blockchains, and iterated Byzantine Fault Tolerant (iBFT) protocols.},

While leader election is a well studied problem, the rise of distributed ledgers (i.e., blockchains) has led to a new perspective on how to perform large-scale leader elections via solving a computationally difficult puzzle (i.e., proof of work). In this paper, we present Caucus, a large-scale leader election protocol with minimal coordination costs that does not require the computational cost of proof-of-work. We evaluate Caucus in terms of its security, using a new model for blockchain-focused leader election, before testing an implementation of Caucus on an Ethereum private network. Our experiments highlight that one variant of Caucus costs only \$0.10 per leader election if deployed on Ethereum.},

	abstract = {Many blockchain-based algorithms, such as Bitcoin, implement a decentralized asset transfer system, often referred to as a cryptocurrency. As stated in the original paper by Nakamoto, at the heart of these systems lies the problem of preventing double-spending; this is usually solved by achieving consensus on the order of transfers among the participants. In this paper, we treat the asset transfer problem as a concurrent object and determine its consensus number, showing that consensus is, in fact, not necessary to prevent double-spending. We first consider the problem as defined by Nakamoto, where only a single process---the account owner---can withdraw from each account. Safety and liveness need to be ensured for correct account owners, whereas misbehaving account owners might be unable to perform transfers. We show that the consensus number of an asset transfer object is \$1\$. We then consider a more general \$k\$-shared asset transfer object where up to \$k\$ processes can atomically withdraw from the same account, and show that this object has consensus number \$k\$. We establish our results in the context of shared memory with benign faults, allowing us to properly understand the level of difficulty of the asset transfer problem. We also translate these results in the message passing setting with Byzantine players, a model that is more relevant in practice. In this model, we describe an asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant asset transfer implementation that is both simpler and more efficient than state-of-the-art consensus-based solutions. Our results are applicable to both the permissioned (private) and permissionless (public) setting, as normally their differentiation is hidden by the abstractions on top of which our algorithms are based.},

	abstract = {The asset trading volume on blockchain-based exchanges (DEX) increased substantially since the advent of Automated Market Makers (AMM). Yet, AMMs and their forks compete on the same blockchain, incurring unnecessary network and block-space overhead, by attracting sandwich attackers and arbitrage competitions. Moreover, conceptually speaking, a blockchain is one database, and we find little reason to partition this database into multiple competing exchanges, which then necessarily require price synchronization through arbitrage. This paper shows that DEX arbitrage and trade routing among similar AMMs can be performed efficiently and atomically on-chain within smart contracts. These insights lead us to create a new AMM design, an Automated Arbitrage Market Maker, short A2MM DEX. A2MM aims to unite multiple AMMs to reduce overheads, costs and increase blockchain security. With respect to Miner Extractable Value (MEV), A2MM serves as a decentralized design for users to atomically collect MEV, mitigating the dangers of centralized MEV relay services. We show that A2MM offers essential security benefits. First, A2MM strengthens the blockchain consensus security by mitigating the competitive exploitation of MEV, therefore reducing the risks of consensus forks. A2MM reduces the network layer overhead of competitive transactions, improves network propagation, leading to less stale blocks and better blockchain security. Through trade routing, A2MM reduces the predatory risks of sandwich attacks by taking advantage of the minimum profitable victim input. A2MM also offers financial benefits to traders. Failed swap transactions from competitive trading occupy valuable block space, implying an upward pressure on transaction fees. Our evaluations shows that A2MM frees up 32.8\% block-space of AMM-related transactions. In expectation, A2MM's revenue allows to reduce swap fees by 90\%.},

To make the analysis tractable, we introduce a hybrid approach that includes (i) a light-weight exploration phase that dramatically reduces the number of instructions to analyze, and (ii) a precise refinement phase based on symbolic evaluation guided by our novel value-summary analysis, which generates extra constraints to over-approximate the side effects of whole-program execution, thereby ensuring the precision of the symbolic evaluation. We developed a prototype of SAILFISH and evaluated its ability to detect two state-inconsistency flaws, viz., reentrancy and transaction order dependence (TOD) in Ethereum smart contracts. Further, we present detection rules for other kinds of smart contract flaws that SAILFISH can be extended to detect. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our hybrid approach as well as the benefit of the value summary analysis. In particular, we show that S SAILFISH outperforms five state-of-the-art smart contract analyzers (SECURITY, MYTHRIL, OYENTE, SEREUM and VANDAL ) in terms of performance, and precision. In total, SAILFISH discovered 47 previously unknown vulnerable smart contracts out of 89,853 smart contracts from ETHERSCAN .},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09535},
	abstract = {Natural forking in blockchain refers to a phenomenon that there are a set of blocks at one block height at the same time, implying that various nodes have different perspectives of the main chain. Natural forking might give rise to multiple adverse impacts on blockchain, jeopardizing the performance and security of the system consequently. However, the ongoing literature in analyzing natural forking is mainly from the macro point of view, which is not sufficient to incisively understand this phenomenon. In this paper, we fill this gap through leveraging the large deviation theory to conduct a microscopic study of natural forking, which resorts to investigating the instantaneous difference between block generation and dissemination in blockchain. Our work is derived comprehensively and complementarily via a three-step process, where both the natural forking probability and its decay rate are presented. Through solid theoretical derivation and extensive numerical simulations, we find 1) the probability of the mismatch between block generation and dissemination exceeding a given threshold dwindles exponentially with the increase of natural forking robustness related parameter or the difference between the block dissemination rate and block creation rate; 2) the natural forking robustness related parameter may emphasize a more dominant effect on accelerating the abortion of natural forking in some cases; 3) when the self-correlated block generation rate is depicted as the stationary autoregressive process with a scaling parameter, it is found that setting a lower scaling parameter may speed up the failure of natural forking. These findings are valuable since they offer a fresh theoretical basis to engineer optimal countermeasures for thwarting natural forking and thereby enlivening the blockchain network.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12351},
	abstract = {Smart contract transactions demonstrate issues of performance and correctness that application programmers must work around. Although the blockchain consensus mechanism approaches ACID compliance, use cases that rely on frequent state changes are impractical due to the block publishing interval of \$O(10{\textasciicircum}1)\$ seconds. The effective isolation level is Read-Committed, only revealing state transitions at the end of the block interval. Values read may be stale and not match program order, causing many transactions to fail when a block is committed. This paper perceives the blockchain as a transactional data structure, using this analogy in the development of a new algorithm, Hash-Mark-Set (HMS), that improves transaction throughput by providing a Read-Uncommitted view of state variables. HMS creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from the pending transaction pool. The transaction order derived from the DAG is used to provide a Read-Uncommitted view of the data for new transactions, which enter the DAG as they are received. An implementation of HMS is provided, interoperable with Ethereum and ready for use in smart contracts. Over a wide range of transaction mixes, HMS is demonstrated to improve throughput. A side product of the implementation is a new technique, Runtime Argument Augmentation (RAA), that allows smart contracts to communicate with external data services before submitting a transaction. RAA has use cases beyond HMS and can serve as a lightweight replacement for blockchain oracles.},

It was well understood that a successful DS attack is established when the proportion of computing power an attacker possesses is higher than that of the honest network. What is not yet well understood is how threatening a DS attack with less than 50\% computing power used can be. Namely, DS attacks at any proportion can be a threat as long as the chance to make a good profit exists. Profit is obtained when the revenue from making a successful DS attack is greater than the cost of carrying out one. We have developed a novel probability theory for calculating a finitetime attack probability. This can be used to size up attack resources needed to obtain the profit. The results enable us to derive a sufficient and necessary condition on the value of a transaction targeted by a DS attack. Our result is quite surprising: we theoretically show how a DS attack at any proportion of computing power can be made profitable. Given one\&rsquo;s transaction value, the results can also be used to assess the risk of a DS attack. An example of profitable DS attack against BitcoinCash is provided.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10172v1},
	abstract = {There exist many forms of Blockchain finality conditions, from deterministic to probabilistic terminations. To favor availability against consistency in the face of partitions, most blockchains only offer probabilistic eventual finality: blocks may be revoked after being appended to the blockchain, yet with decreasing probability as they sink deeper into the chain. Other blockchains favor consistency by leveraging the immediate finality of Consensus-a block appended is never revoked-at the cost of additional synchronization. In this paper, we focus on necessary and sufficient conditions to implement a blockchain with deterministic eventual finality, which ensures that selected main chains at different processes share a common increasing prefix. This is a much weaker form of finality that allows us to provide a solution in an asynchronous system subject to unlimited number of byzantine failures. We study stronger forms of eventual finality as well and show that it is unfortunately impossible to provide a bounded displacement. By bounded displacement we mean that the (unknown) number of blocks that can be revoked from the current blockchain is bounded. This problem reduces to consensus or eventual consensus depending on whether the bound is known or not. We also show that the classical selection mechanism, such as in Bitcoin, that appends blocks at the longest chain is not compliant with a solution to eventual finality.},

Especially the storage of unwanted data in a blockchain is an issue, because it cannot be removed naturally. In order to counteract this problem, we present the first concept for the selective deletion of single entries in a blockchain. For this purpose, the general consensus algorithm is extended by the functionality of regularly creating summary blocks. Previous data of the chain are summarized and stored again in a new block, leaving out unwanted information. With a shifting marker of the Genesis Block, data can be deleted from the beginning of a blockchain. In this way, the technology of the blockchain becomes fully transactional. The concept is independent of a specific block structure, network structure, or consensus algorithm. Moreover, this functionality can be adapted to current blockchains to solve multiple problems related to scalability. This approach enables the transfer of blockchain technology to further fields of application, among others in the area of Industry 4.0 and Product Life-cycle Management.},

To execute a finality delay an attacker uses delayed block releases and withholding of attestations to increase the mean and variance of the time it takes blocks to become finalized. This impacts the efficiency and predictability of the system. We provide a probabilistic and cost analysis for each of these attacks, considering a validator with 30\% of the total stake.},

Its decentralization, immutability, and transparency have attracted many applications to adopt the design philosophy of blockchain and customize various replicated solutions. Under the hood of blockchain, consensus protocols play the most important role to achieve distributed replication systems. The distributed system community has extensively studied the technical components of consensus to reach agreement among a group of nodes. Due to trust issues, it is hard to design a resilient system in practical situations because of the existence of various faults. Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) state machine replication (SMR) is regarded as an ideal candidate that can tolerate arbitrary faulty behaviors. However, the inherent complexity of BFT consensus protocols and their rapid evolution makes it hard to practically adapt themselves into application domains. There are many excellent Byzantine-based replicated solutions and ideas that have been contributed to improving performance, availability, or resource efficiency. This paper conducts a systematic and comprehensive study on BFT consensus protocols with a specific focus on the blockchain era. We explore both general principles and practical schemes to achieve consensus under Byzantine settings. We then survey, compare, and categorize the state-of-the-art solutions to understand BFT consensus in detail. For each representative protocol, we conduct an in-depth discussion of its most important architectural building blocks as well as the key techniques they used. We aim that this paper can provide system researchers and developers a concrete view of the current design landscape and help them find solutions to concrete problems. Finally, we present several critical challenges and some potential research directions to advance the research on exploring BFT consensus protocols in the age of blockchains.},

	abstract = {The spectacular success of Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology in recent years has provided enough evidence that a widespread adoption of a common cryptocurrency system is not merely a distant vision, but a scenario that might come true in the near future. However, the presence of Bitcoin's obvious shortcomings such as excessive electricity consumption, unsatisfying transaction throughput, and large validation time (latency) makes it clear that a new, more efficient system is needed. We propose a protocol in which a set of nodes maintains and updates a linear ordering of transactions that are being submitted by users. Virtually every cryptocurrency system has such a protocol at its core, and it is the efficiency of this protocol that determines the overall throughput and latency of the system. We develop our protocol on the grounds of the well-established field of Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (ABFT) systems. This allows us to formally reason about correctness, efficiency, and security in the strictest possible model, and thus convincingly prove the overall robustness of our solution. Our protocol improves upon the state-of-the-art HoneyBadgerBFT by Miller et al. by reducing the asymptotic latency while matching the optimal communication complexity. Furthermore, in contrast to the above, our protocol does not require a trusted dealer thanks to a novel implementation of a trustless ABFT Randomness Beacon.},

	abstract = {Blockchain-based Distributed Ledgers (DLs) promise to transform the existing financial system by making it truly democratic. In the past decade, blockchain technology has seen many novel applications ranging from the banking industry to real estate. However, in order to be adopted universally, blockchain systems must be scalable to support a high volume of transactions. As we increase the throughput of the DL system, the underlying peer-to-peer network might face multiple levels of challenges to keep up with the requirements. Due to varying network capacities, the slower nodes would be at a relative disadvantage compared to the faster ones, which could negatively impact their revenue. In order to quantify their relative advantage or disadvantage, we introduce two measures of network fairness, \$p\_f\$, the probability of frontrunning and \${\textbackslash}alpha\_f\$, the publishing fairness. We show that as we scale the blockchain, both these measures deteriorate, implying that the slower nodes face a disadvantage at higher throughputs. It results in the faster nodes getting more than their fair share of the reward while the slower nodes (slow in terms of network quality) get less. Thus, fairness and scalability in blockchain systems do not go hand in hand. In a setting with rational miners, lack of fairness causes miners to deviate from the "longest chain rule" or undercut, which would reduce the blockchain's resilience against byzantine adversaries. Hence, fairness is not only a desirable property for a blockchain system but also essential for the security of the blockchain and any scalable blockchain protocol proposed must ensure fairness.},

	abstract = {Digital signatures are used to verify the authenticity of digital messages, that is, to know with a high level of certainty, that a digital message was created by a known sender and was not altered in any way. This is usually achieved by using asymmetric cryptography, where a secret key is used by the signer, and the corresponding public key is used by those who wish to verify the signed data. In many use-cases, such as blockchain, the history and order of the signed data, thus the signatures themselves, are important. In blockchains specifically, the threat is forks, where one can double-spend its crypto-currency if one succeeds to publish two valid transactions on two different branches of the chain. We introduce a single private/public key pair signature scheme using verifiable random function, that binds a signer to its signature history. The scheme enforces a single ordered signatures' history using a deterministic verifiable chain of signature functions that also reveals the secret key in case of misbehaviors.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05543},
	abstract = {Modern blockchains support a variety of distributed applications beyond cryptocurrencies, including smart contracts -- which let users execute arbitrary code in a distributed and decentralized fashion. Regardless of their intended application, blockchain platforms implicitly assume consensus for the correct execution of a smart contract, thus requiring that all transactions are totally ordered. It was only recently recognized that consensus is not necessary to prevent double-spending in a cryptocurrency (Guerraoui et al., PODC'19), contrary to common belief. This result suggests that current implementations may be sacrificing efficiency and scalability because they synchronize transactions much more tightly than actually needed. In this work, we study the synchronization requirements of Ethereum's ERC20 token contract, one of the most widely adopted smart contacts. Namely, we model a smart-contract token as a concurrent object and analyze its consensus number as a measure of synchronization power. We show that the richer set of methods supported by ERC20 tokens, compared to standard cryptocurrencies, results in strictly stronger synchronization requirements. More surprisingly, the synchronization power of ERC20 tokens depends on the object's state and can thus be modified by method invocations. To prove this result, we develop a dedicated framework to express how the object's state affects the needed synchronization level. Our findings indicate that ERC20 tokens, as well as other token standards, are more powerful and versatile than plain cryptocurrencies, and are subject to dynamic requirements. Developing specific synchronization protocols that exploit these dynamic requirements will pave the way towards more robust and scalable blockchain platforms.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07220},
	abstract = {Blockchain systems, such as Ethereum, use an approach called "metering" to assign a cost to smart contract execution, an approach which is designed to incentivise miners to operate the network and protect it against DoS attacks. In the past, the imperfections of Ethereum metering allowed several DoS attacks which were countered through modification of the metering mechanism. This paper presents a new DoS attack on Ethereum which systematically exploits its metering mechanism. We first replay and analyse several months of transactions, during which we discover a number of discrepancies in the metering model, such as significant inconsistencies in the pricing of the instructions. We further demonstrate that there is very little correlation between the execution cost and the utilised resources, such as CPU and memory. Based on these observations, we present a new type of DoS attack we call Resource Exhaustion Attack, which uses these imperfections to generate low-throughput contracts. To do this, we design a genetic algorithm that generates contracts with a throughput on average 200 times slower than typical contracts. We then show that all major Ethereum client implementations are vulnerable and, if running on commodity hardware, would be unable to stay in sync with the network when under attack. We argue that such an attack could be financially attractive not only for Ethereum competitors and speculators, but also for Ethereum miners. Finally, we discuss short-term and potential long-term fixes against such attacks. Our attack has been responsibly disclosed to the Ethereum Foundation and awarded a bug bounty reward of 5,000 USD.},

block space by accounting for orphaning risk. The latter represents the fees offered by the
transactions in mempool, and is expressed versus the minimum block size required to claim
a given portion of the fees. The paper explains how the supply and demand curves from
classical economics are related to the derivatives of these two curves, and proves that
producing the quantity of block space indicated by their intersection point maximizes the
miner{\textquoteright}s profit. The paper then shows that an unhealthy fee market{\textemdash}where miners are
incentivized to produce arbitrarily large blocks{\textemdash}cannot exist since it requires
communicating information at an arbitrarily fast rate. The paper concludes by considering
the conditions under which a rational miner would produce big, small or empty blocks, and
by estimating the cost of a spam attack.},

because it enables individual participants to independently effect quorum slice decisions; the overlap
of quorum slice decisions on the network gives rise to the network-wide rule for consensus. FCP is
both leaderless and totally-ordered, making it excessively difficult for an attacker to influence which
of two transactions will be ordered first in a transaction set. FCP is also asynchronous and much
simpler than previous FBA constructions due to leveraging a novel federated consensus mechanism
called federated virtual voting. These properties make FCP a compelling model for internet-level
Turing-complete consensus},

We analyze the performance of the longest-chain protocol under the assumption that the communication delays are random, independent, and identically distributed. This communication model allows for distributions with unbounded support and is a strict generalization of the synchronous model. We provide safety and liveness guarantees with simple, explicit bounds on the failure probabilities. These bounds hold for infinite-horizon executions and decay exponentially with the security parameter. In particular, we show that the longest-chain protocol has good security guarantees when delays are sporadically large and possibly unbounded, which is reflective of real-world network conditions.},

The main processing units are off-the-shelf minicomputers, with standard microcomputers serving as the interface to the I/O system. Fault isolation is achieved by using a specially designed redundant bus system to interconnect the proeessing units. Error detection and analysis and system reconfiguration are performed by software. Iterative tasks are redundantly executed, and the results of each iteration are voted upon before being used. Thus, any single failure in a processing unit or bus can be tolerated with triplication of tasks, and subsequent failures can be tolerated after reconfiguration. Independent execution by separate processors means that the processors need only be loosely synchronized, and a novel fault-tolerant synchronization method is described. The SIFT software is highly structured and is formally specified using the SRI-developed SPECIAL language. The correctness of SIFT is to be proved using a hierarchy of formal models. A Markov model is used both to analyze the reliability of the system and to serve as the formal requirement for the SIFT design. Axioms are given to characterize the high-level behavior of the system, from which a correctness statement has been proved. An engineering test version of SIFT is currently being built.},

	abstract = {Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols allow a group of replicas to come to consensus even when some of the replicas are Byzantine faulty. There exist multiple BFT protocols to securely tolerate an optimal number of faults \$t\$ under different network settings. However, if the number of faults \$f\$ exceeds \$t\$ then security could be violated. Motivated by blockchain applications, we systematically study the forensic support of BFT protocols: we aim to identify (with cryptographic integrity) as many of the malicious replicas as possible, by as many participating replicas as possible and in as distributed manner as possible. Our main (positive) result is that well-known BFT protocols such as PBFT, HotStuff, and VABA have strong forensic support; we show that when \$f\$ exceeds \$t\$, at least \$t+1\$ of culpable replicas can be identified by at least \$2t+1-f\$ honest replicas. On the other hand, when \$t\$ is as much as half the number of replicas (e.g. in a synchronous network), then all but one of the malicious replicas must go undetected; this impossibility result holds for all BFT protocols and even if one has access to the states of all replicas (including Byzantine ones).},

	abstract = {In recent years, manifold blockchain protocols have been proposed by researchers and industrial companies alike. This has led to a very heterogeneous blockchain landscape. Accordingly, it would be desirable if blockchains could interact with each other. However, current blockchain technologies offer only limited support for interoperability, thus preventing tokens or smart contracts from leaving the scope of a particular blockchain. As a first step towards a solution for cross-chain smart contract interactions, we introduce a framework which allows to invoke a smart contract from another blockchain. We offer support for continuing a smart contract after receiving a result from a different blockchain, and for calling smart contracts recursively across blockchains. We provide a reference implementation for Ethereum-based blockchains using Solidity and evaluate the performance regarding time and cost overheads.},

	abstract = {Many empirical software engineering studies show that there is a great need for repositories where source code is acquired, filtered and classified. During the last few years, Ethereum block explorer services have emerged as a popular project to explore and search Ethereum blockchain data such as transactions, addresses, tokens, smart-contracts' source code, prices and other activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain. Despite the availability of this kind of services, retrieving specific information useful to empirical software engineering studies, such as the study of smart-contracts' software metrics might require many sub-tasks, such as searching specific transactions in a block, parsing files in HTML format and filtering the smart-contracts to remove duplicated code or unused smart-contracts. In this paper we afford this problem creating Smart Corpus', a Corpus of Smart Contracts in an organized reasoned and up to date repository where Solidity source code and other metadata about Ethereum smart contracts can easily and systematically be retrieved. We present the Smart Corpus' design and its initial implementation and we show how the data-set of smart contracts' source code in a variety of programming languages can be queried and processed, get useful information on smart contracts and their software metrics. The Smart Corpus aims to create a smart-contracts' repository where smart contracts data (source code, ABI and byte-code) are freely and immediately available and also classified based on the main software metrics identified in the scientific literature. Smart-contracts source code has been validated by EtherScan and each contract comes with its own associated software metrics as computed by the freely available software PASO. Moreover, Smart Corpus can be easily extended, as the number of new smart-contracts increases day by day.},

	abstract = {With upcoming blockchain infrastructures, world-spanning Byzantine consensus is getting practical and necessary. In geographically distributed systems, the pace at which consensus is achieved is limited by the heterogenous latencies of connections between replicas. If deployed on a wide-area network, consensus-based systems benefit from weighted replication, an approach that utilizes extra replicas and assigns higher voting power to well connected replicas. This enables more choice in quorum formation and replicas can leverage proportionally smaller quorums to advance, thus decreasing consensus latency. However, the system needs a solution to autonomously adjust to its environment if network conditions change or faults occur. We present Adaptive Wide-Area REplication (AWARE), a mechanism which improves the geographical scalability of consensus with nodes being widely spread across the world. Essentially, AWARE is an automated and dynamic voting weight tuning and leader positioning scheme, which supports the emergence of fast quorums in the system. It employs a reliable self-monitoring process and provides a prediction model seeking to minimize the system's consensus latency. In experiments using several AWS EC2 regions, AWARE dynamically optimizes consensus latency by self-reliantly finding a fast weight configuration yielding latency gains observed by clients located across the globe.},

In this paper, we focus on transaction propagation and show that increasing the participation of unreachable nodes can potentially improve the robustness and efficiency of the network. In order to do that, we propose a few changes to the network protocol. Additionally, we design a novel transaction propagation protocol that explicitly involves unreachable nodes to provide better protection against deanonymization attacks.

	abstract = {The hype about Bitcoin has overrated the potential of smart contracts deployed on-blockchains (on-chains) and underrated the potential of smart contracts deployed on-Trusted Third Parties (on-TTPs). As a result, current research and development in this field is focused mainly on smart contract applications that use on-chain smart contracts. We argue that there is a large class of smart contract applications where on-TTP smart contracts are a better alternative. The problem with on-chain smart contracts is that the fully decentralised model and indelible append-only data model followed by blockchains introduces several engineering problems that are hard to solve. In these situations, the inclusion of a TTP (assuming that the application can tolerate its inconveniences) instead of a blockchain to host the smart contract simplifies the problems and offers pragmatic solutions. The intention and contribution of this paper is to shed some light on this issue. We use a hypothetical use case of a car insurance application to illustrate technical problems that are easier to solve with on-TTP smart contracts than with on-chain smart contracts.},

	abstract = {Payment channel networks are a highly discussed approach for improving scalability of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. As they allow processing transactions off-chain, payment channel networks are referred to as second layer technology, while the blockchain is the first layer. We uncouple payment channel networks from blockchains and look at them as first-class citizens. This brings up the question what model payment channel networks require as first layer. In response, we formalize a model (called RFL Model) for a first layer below a payment channel network. While transactions are globally made available by a blockchain, the RFL Model only provides the reduced property that a transaction is delivered to the users being affected by a transaction. We show that the reduced model's properties still suffice to implement payment channels. By showing that the RFL Model can not only be instantiated by the Bitcoin blockchain but also by trusted third parties like banks, we show that the reduction widens the design space for the first layer. Further, we show that the stronger property provided by blockchains allows for optimizations that can be used to reduce the time for locking collateral during payments over multiple hops in a payment channel network.},

But digital identity solutions - ID checking, biometrics, self-sovereign identity, and trust networks - all present flaws, leaving users vulnerable to exclusion, identity loss or theft, and coercion. These flaws may be insurmountable because digital identity is a cart pulling the horse. We cannot achieve digital identity secure enough for the weight of digital democracy, until we build it on a solid foundation of "digital personhood." While identity is about distinguishing one person from another through attributes or affiliations, personhood is about giving all real people inalienable digital participation rights independent of identity, including protection against erosion of their democratic rights through identity loss, theft, coercion, or fakery. We explore and analyze alternative approaches to "proof of personhood" that may provide this missing foundation. Pseudonym parties marry the transparency of periodic physical-world events with the power of digital tokens between events. These tokens represent limited-term but renewable claims usable for purposes such as online voting or liquid democracy, sampled juries or deliberative polls, abuse-resistant social communication, or minting universal basic income in a permissionless cryptocurrency. Enhancing pseudonym parties to provide participants a moment of enforced physical security and privacy can address coercion and vote-buying risks that plague today's E-voting systems. We also examine other proposed approaches to proof of personhood, some of which offer conveniences such as all-online participation. These alternatives currently fall short of satisfying all the key digital personhood goals, unfortunately, but offer valuable insights into the challenges we face.},

However, real blockchain systems are too complex to conduct any test on or benchmark the developed protocols. Some simulation environments have been proposed recently, such as BlockSim (Maher et al., '20). However, BlockSim is developed for the simulation of an entire network on a single CPU. Therefore, it is insufficient to capture the essence of a real blockchain network, as it is not distributed and the complications such as propagation delays that occur in reality cannot be simulated realistically enough.

	abstract = {Nakamoto{\textquoteright}s Bitcoin protocol inspired interest in the permissionless regime of distributed computing, in which participants may join and leave an internet-scale protocol execution at will. The permissionless regime poses challenges to the classical techniques used for consensus protocols, in which participants attempt to agree on a function of their inputs. Crucially, classical consensus techniques require honest participants to remain online and active, and to know an upperbound on the number of participants. Bitcoin addresses this issue by requiring Proof of Work, and other Bitcoin-inspired works have developed Proof of X (PoX) variants to remediate the shortcomings of Proof of Work. We propose an abstraction for PoX called resources, and argue that in practice, several variants appear to implement resources. We then show that given few additional assumptions, resources are sufficient to achieve consensus in the permissionless regime, even in the presence of a full-information adversary that can choose which parties get resources and when they get them. In particular, it is not necessary to know a bound on the network delay, participants do not need clocks, and participants can join and leave the execution arbitrarily, even after sending only a single message. We require only a known upperbound on the rate at which resources enter the system, relative to the maximum network delay (without needing to know the network delay), and that over the long term, a majority of resources are acquired by honest participants. Along the way, we provide a generalization of blockchains called graph consensus. We present a graph consensus protocol for the permissionless regime that works even when resources enter the system at high rates, but the required honest majority increases with the rate. We show how to modify the protocol slightly to achieve one-bit consensus. Finally, we show that for every graph consensus protocol that outputs a majority of honest vertices there exists a one-bit consensus protocol.},

Our protocol features proofs which grow only logarithmically in the size of the "anonymity sets" used, improving upon the linear growth attained by prior efforts.

Our central tool is a new family of extensions to Groth and Kohlweiss's one-out-of-many proofs (Eurocrypt 2015), which efficiently prove statements about many messages among a list of commitments. These extensions prove knowledge of a secret subset of a public list, and assert that the commitments in the subset satisfy certain properties (expressed as linear equations). Remarkably, our communication remains logarithmic; our computation increases only by a logarithmic multiplicative factor. This technique is likely to be of independent interest.

Such protocols incur delays which severely limit the throughput of such ledgers. Payment and state channels enable execution of offchain protocols that allow interaction between parties without involving the consensus protocol. Protocols such as Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLC) and Sprites (FC'19) connect channels into Payment Channel Networks (PCN) allowing payments across a path of payment channels. Such a payment requires each party to lock away funds for an amount of time. The product of funds and locktime is the collateral of the party, i.e., their cost of opportunity to forward a payment. In the case of HTLC, the locktime is linear to the length of the path, making the total collateral invested across the path quadratic in size of its length. Sprites improved on this by reducing the locktime to a constant by utilizing smart contracts. Atomic Multi-Channel Updates (AMCU), published at CCS'19, introduced constant collateral payments without smart contracts. In this work we present the Channel Closure attack on AMCU that allows a malicious adversary to make honest parties lose funds. Furthermore, we propose the Payment Trees protocol that allows payments across a PCN with linear total collateral without the aid of smart contracts.

The insight in this technical note is that the block creator can be restricted to the task of ensuring no double spends. The task of actually verifying transaction balances really belongs to the receiver. The receiver is the one motivated to verify that she is receiving a valid transaction output since she has to convince the next receiver that the balances are valid, otherwise no one will accept her spending transaction. The bulk of the transaction can thus be encrypted in such a manner that only the receiver can decrypt and examine it. Opening this transaction allows the receiver to also open previous transactions to allow her to work her way backward in a chain until she arrives at the coin generation blocks and completely verify the validity of the transaction. Since transactions are encrypted on the blockchain a blockchain analyzer cannot create a transaction graph until he is the receiver of a transaction that allows backward tracing through to some target transaction.},

	abstract = {The Lightning Network promises to alleviate Bitcoin's known scalability problems. The operation of such second layer approaches relies on the ability of participants to turn to the blockchain to claim funds at any time, which is assumed to happen rarely. One of the risks that was identified early on is that of a wide systemic attack on the protocol, in which an attacker triggers the closure of many Lightning channels at once. The resulting high volume of transactions in the blockchain will not allow for the proper settlement of all debts, and attackers may get away with stealing some funds. This paper explores the details of such an attack and evaluates its cost and overall impact on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. Specifically, we show that an attacker is able to simultaneously cause victim nodes to overload the Bitcoin blockchain with requests and to steal funds that were locked in channels. We go on to examine the interaction of Lightning nodes with the fee estimation mechanism and show that the attacker can continuously lower the fee of transactions that will later be used by the victim in its attempts to recover funds - eventually reaching a state in which only low fractions of the block are available for lightning transactions. Our attack is made easier even further as the Lightning protocol allows the attacker to increase the fee offered by his own transactions. We continue to empirically show that the vast majority of nodes agree to channel opening requests from unknown sources and are therefore susceptible to this attack. We highlight differences between various implementations of the Lightning Network protocol and review the susceptibility of each one to the attack. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies to lower the systemic attack risk of the network.},

	abstract = {Credit allows a lender to loan out surplus capital to a borrower. In the traditional economy, credit bears the risk that the borrower may default on its debt, the lender hence requires an upfront collateral from the borrower, plus interest fee payments. Due to the atomicity of blockchain transactions, lenders can offer flash loans, i.e. loans that are only valid within one transaction and must be repaid by the end of that transaction. This concept has lead to a number of interesting attack possibilities, some of which have been exploited recently (February 2020). This paper is the first to explore the implication of flash loans for the nascent decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. We analyze two existing attacks vectors with significant ROIs (beyond 500k\%), and then go on to formulate finding flash loan-based attack parameters as an optimization problem over the state of the underlying Ethereum blockchain as well as the state of the DeFi ecosystem. Specifically, we show how two previously executed attacks can be "boosted" to result in a profit of 829.5k USD and 1.1M USD, respectively, which is a boost of 2.37x and 1.73x, respectively.},

	abstract = {Smart contract is a special program that manages digital assets on
blockchain. It is difficult to recover the loss if users make transactions
through buggy smart contracts, which cannot be directly fixed. Hence, it is
important to ensure the correctness of smart contracts before deploying them.
This paper proposes a systematic framework to mutation testing for smart
contracts on Ethereum, which is currently the most popular open blockchain for
deploying and running smart contracts. Fifteen novel mutation operators have
been designed for Ethereum Smart Contracts (ESC), in terms of keyword, global
variable/function, variable unit, and error handling. An empirical study on 26
smart contracts in four Ethereum DApps has been conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of mutation testing. The experimental results show that our
approach can outperform the coverage-based approach on defect detection rate
(96.01\% vs. 55.68\%). The ESC mutation operators are effective to reveal real
defects and we found 117 out of 729 real bug reports are related to our
operators. These show the great potential of using mutation testing for quality
assurance of ESC.},

infrastructure of the blockchain, which often manage valuable digital assets.
Solidity is one of the most popular programming languages for writing smart
contracts on the Ethereum platform. Like traditional programs, smart contracts
may contain vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional programs, smart contracts
cannot be easily patched once they are deployed. It is thus important that
smart contracts are tested thoroughly before deployment. In this work, we
present an adaptive fuzzer for smart contracts on the Ethereum platform called
sFuzz. Compared to existing Solidity fuzzers, sFuzz combines the strategy in
the AFL fuzzer and an efficient lightweight multi-objective adaptive strategy
targeting those hard-to-cover branches. sFuzz has been applied to more than 4
thousand smart contracts and the experimental results show that (1) sFuzz is
efficient, e.g., two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art tools;
(2) sFuzz is effective in achieving high code coverage and discovering
vulnerabilities; and (3) the different fuzzing strategies in sFuzz complement
each other.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06944v1},
	abstract = {We present Harvey, an industrial greybox fuzzer for smart contracts, which
are programs managing accounts on a blockchain. Greybox fuzzing is a
lightweight test-generation approach that effectively detects bugs and security
vulnerabilities. However, greybox fuzzers randomly mutate program inputs to
exercise new paths; this makes it challenging to cover code that is guarded by
narrow checks, which are satisfied by no more than a few input values.
Moreover, most real-world smart contracts transition through many different
states during their lifetime, e.g., for every bid in an auction. To explore
these states and thereby detect deep vulnerabilities, a greybox fuzzer would
need to generate sequences of contract transactions, e.g., by creating bids
from multiple users, while at the same time keeping the search space and test
suite tractable. In this experience paper, we explain how Harvey alleviates
both challenges with two key fuzzing techniques and distill the main lessons
learned. First, Harvey extends standard greybox fuzzing with a method for
predicting new inputs that are more likely to cover new paths or reveal
vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Second, it fuzzes transaction sequences in
a targeted and demand-driven way. We have evaluated our approach on 27
real-world contracts. Our experiments show that the underlying techniques
significantly increase Harvey's effectiveness in achieving high coverage and
detecting vulnerabilities, in most cases orders-of-magnitude faster; they also
reveal new insights about contract code.},

	shorttitle = {Diogenes},
	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/374},
	abstract = {In this work, we design and implement the first protocol for RSA modulus construction that can support thousands of parties and offers security against an arbitrary number of corrupted parties.

In a nutshell, we design the ``best'' protocol for this scale that is secure against passive corruption, then amplify it to obtain active security using efficient non-interactive zero-knowledge arguments. Our protocol satisfies a stronger security guarantee where a deviating party can be identified when the protocol aborts (referred to as security with identifiable-abort) and allows for ``public verifiability''.

Our passively secure protocol extends the recent work of Chen et al. that, in turn, is based on the blueprint introduced in the original work of Boneh-Franklin protocol (CRYPTO 1997, J. ACM, 2001). Specifically, we reduce the task of sampling a modulus to secure distributed multiplication, which we implement via an efficient threshold additively homomorphic encryption (AHE) scheme based on the Ring-LWE assumption. This results in a protocol where the amortized per-party communication cost grows logarithmically in the number of parties. In order to keep the parties lightweight, we employ an ``untrusted'' coordinator that is connected to all parties and performs all public and broadcast operations.

We amplify this protocol to obtain active security (with identifiable-abort) by attaching zero-knowledge proofs. We instantiate our ZK proof system by composing two different types of ZK proof systems: (1) the Ligero sub-linear zero-knowledge proof system (Ames et al., CCS 2017), and (2) Sigma-protocol for proving the knowledge of a discrete logarithm in unknown order groups (Shoup, Eurocrypt 2000).

We implemented both the passive and the active variants of our protocol and ran experiments using 2 to 4,000 parties. This is the first such implementation of any MPC protocol that can scale to more than 1,000 parties. For generating a 2048-bit modulus among 1,000 parties, our passive protocol executed in under 4 minutes and the active variant ran in 22 minutes.},

Smart contracts handle and transfer assets of values, offering strong incentives for malicious attacks. Intrusion attacks are a popular type of malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose ContractGuard, the first intrusion detection system (IDS) to defend Ethereum smart contracts against such attacks. Like IDSs for conventional programs, ContractGuard detects intrusion attempts as abnormal control flow. However, existing IDS techniques/tools are inapplicable to Ethereum smart contracts due to Ethereum's decentralized nature and its highly restrictive execution environment. To address these issues, we design ContractGuard by embedding it in the contracts to profile context-tagged acyclic paths, and optimizing it under the Ethereum gas-oriented performance model. The main goal is to minimize the overheads, to which the users will be extremely sensitive since the cost needs to be paid upfront in digital concurrency. Empirical investigation using real-life contracts deployed in the Ethereum mainnet shows that on average, ContractGuard only adds to 36.14\% of the deployment overhead and 28.27\% of the runtime overhead. Furthermore, we conducted controlled experiments and show that ContractGuard successfully guard against attacks on all real-world vulnerabilities and 83\% of the seeded vulnerabilities.},

	abstract = {Payment channel networks are a promising approach to improve the scalability of cryptocurrencies: they allow to perform transactions in a peer-to-peer fashion, along multi-hop routes in the network, without requiring consensus on the blockchain. However, during the discovery of cost-efficient routes for the transaction, critical information may be revealed about the transacting entities. This paper initiates the study of privacy-preserving route discovery mechanisms for payment channel networks. In particular, we present LightPIR, an approach which allows a source to efficiently discover a shortest path to its destination without revealing any information about the endpoints of the transaction. The two main observations which allow for an efficient solution in LightPIR are that: (1) surprisingly, hub labelling algorithms - which were developed to preprocess "street network like" graphs so one can later efficiently compute shortest paths - also work well for the graphs underlying payment channel networks, and that (2) hub labelling algorithms can be directly combined with private information retrieval. LightPIR relies on a simple hub labeling heuristic on top of existing hub labeling algorithms which leverages the specific topological features of cryptocurrency networks to further minimize storage and bandwidth overheads. In a case study considering the Lightning network, we show that our approach is an order of magnitude more efficient compared to a privacy-preserving baseline based on using private information retrieval on a database that stores all pairs shortest paths.},

While vulnerability detectors can prevent vulnerable contracts from being deployed, this does not mean that such contracts will not be deployed. Once a vulnerable contract is instantiated on the blockchain and becomes the target of attacks, the identification of exploit transactions becomes indispensable in assessing whether it has been actually exploited and identifying which malicious or subverted accounts were involved. In this work, we study the problem of post-factum investigation of Ethereum attacks using Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) specially crafted for use in the blockchain. IoC definitions need to capture the side-effects of successful exploitation in the context of the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, we define a model for smart contract execution, comprising multiple abstraction levels that mirror the multiple views of code execution on a blockchain. Subsequently, we compare IoCs defined across the different levels in terms of their effectiveness and practicality through EtherClue, a prototype tool for investigating Ethereum security incidents. Our results illustrate that coarse-grained IoCs defined over blocks of transactions can detect exploit transactions with less computation; however, they are contract-specific and suffer from false negatives. On the other hand, fine-grained IoCs defined over virtual machine instructions can avoid these pitfalls at the expense of increased computation which are nevertheless applicable for practical use.},

	abstract = {Financial options are contracts that specify the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a strike price by an expiration date. Standard exchanges offer options of predetermined strike values and trade options of different strikes independently, even for those written on the same underlying asset. Such independent market design can introduce arbitrage opportunities and lead to the thin market problem. The paper first proposes a mechanism that consolidates and matches orders on standard options related to the same underlying asset, while providing agents the flexibility to specify any custom strike value. The mechanism generalizes the classic double auction, runs in time polynomial to the number of orders, and poses no risk to the exchange, regardless of the value of the underlying asset at expiration. Empirical analysis on real-market options data shows that the mechanism can find new matches for options of different strike prices and reduce bid-ask spreads. Extending standard options written on a single asset, we propose and define a new derivative instrument -- combinatorial financial options that offer contract holders the right to buy or sell any linear combination of multiple underlying assets. We generalize our single-asset mechanism to match options written on different combinations of assets, and prove that optimal clearing of combinatorial financial options is coNP-hard. To facilitate market operations, we propose an algorithm that finds the exact optimal match through iterative constraint generation, and evaluate its performance on synthetically generated combinatorial options markets of different scales. As option prices reveal the market's collective belief of an underlying asset's future value, a combinatorial options market enables the expression of aggregate belief about future correlations among assets.},

	abstract = {Decentralized and permissionless ledgers offer an inherently low transaction rate, as a result of their consensus protocol demanding the storage of each transaction on-chain. A prominent proposal to tackle this scalability issue is to utilize off-chain protocols, where parties only need to post a limited number of transactions on-chain. Existing solutions can roughly be categorized into: (i) application-specific channels (e.g., payment channels), offering strictly weaker functionality than the underlying blockchain; and (ii) state channels, supporting arbitrary smart contracts at the cost of being compatible only with the few blockchains having Turing-complete scripting languages (e.g., Ethereum). In this work, we introduce and formalize the notion of generalized channels allowing users to perform any operation supported by the underlying blockchain in an off-chain manner. Generalized channels thus extend the functionality of payment channels and relax the definition of state channels. We present a concrete construction compatible with any blockchain supporting transaction authorization, time-locks and constant number of Booleanandoperations -- requirements fulfilled by many (non-Turing-complete) blockchains including the popular Bitcoin. To this end, we leverage adaptor signatures -- a cryptographic primitive already used in the cryptocurrency literature but formalized as a standalone primitive in this work for the first time. We formally prove the security of our generalized channel construction in the Universal Composability framework. As an important practical contribution, our generalized channel construction outperforms the state-of-the-art payment channel construction, the Lightning Network, in efficiency. Concretely, it halves the off-chain communication complexity and reduces the on-chain footprint in case of disputes from linear to constant in the number of off-chain applications funded by the channel. Finally, we evaluate the practicality of our construction via a prototype implementation and discuss various applications including financially secured fair two-party computation.},

	abstract = {We introduce the Clockwork Finance Framework (CFF), a general purpose, formal verification framework for mechanized reasoning about the economic security properties of composed decentralized-finance (DeFi) smart contracts.

CFF features three key properties. It is contract complete, meaning that it can model any smart contract platform and all its contracts---Turing complete or otherwise. It does so with asymptotically optimal model size. It is also attack-exhaustive by construction, meaning that it can automatically and mechanically extract all possible economic attacks on users' cryptocurrency across modeled contracts. Thanks to these properties, CFF can support multiple goals: economic security analysis of contracts by developers, analysis of DeFi trading risks by users, and optimization of arbitrage opportunities by bots or miners. Because CFF offers composability, it can support these goals with reasoning over any desired set of potentially interacting smart contract models.

We instantiate CFF as an executable model for Ethereum contracts that incorporates a state-of-the-art deductive verifier. Building on previous work, we introduce extractable value (EV), a new formal notion of economic security in composed DeFi contracts that is both a basis for CFF analyses and of general interest.

We construct modular, human-readable, composable CFF models of four popular, deployed DeFi protocols in Ethereum: Uniswap, Uniswap V2, Sushiswap, and MakerDAO, representing a combined 17 billion USD in value as of August 2021. We uses these models to show experimentally that CFF is practical and can drive useful, data-based EV-based insights from real world transaction activity. Without any explicitly programmed attack strategies, CFF uncovers on average an expected \$56 million of EV per month in the recent past.},

We note that MR provides this multivalued consensus object (which accepts proposals taken from a set with a finite number of values) assuming the availability of a single Binary consensus object (which accepts proposals taken from the set \{0,1\}). This work, which focuses on multivalued consensus, aims at the design of an even more robust solution than MR. Our proposal expands MR's fault-model with self-stabilization, a vigorous notion of fault-tolerance. In addition to tolerating Byzantine and communication failures, self-stabilizing systems can automatically recover after the occurrence of {\textbackslash}emph\{arbitrary transient-faults\}. These faults represent any violation of the assumptions according to which the system was designed to operate (provided that the algorithm code remains intact). We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first self-stabilizing solution for intrusion-tolerant multivalued consensus for asynchronous message-passing systems prone to Byzantine failures.},

	abstract = {In the high-stakes race to develop more scalable blockchains, some platforms (Cosmos, EOS, TRON, etc.) have adopted committee-based consensus protocols, whereby the blockchain's record-keeping rights are entrusted to a committee of elected block producers. In theory, the smaller the committee, the faster the blockchain can reach consensus and the more it can scale. What's less clear, is whether this mechanism ensures that honest committees can be consistently elected, given voters typically have limited information. Using EOS' Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) protocol as a backdrop, we show that identifying the optimal voting strategy is complex and practically out of reach. We empirically characterize some simpler (suboptimal) voting strategies that token holders resort to in practice and show that these nonetheless converge to optimality, exponentially quickly. This yields efficiency gains over other PoS protocols that rely on randomized block producer selection. Our results suggest that (elected) committee-based consensus, as implemented in DPoS, can be robust and efficient, despite its complexity.},

	abstract = {In blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, users compete in a transaction fee auction to get their transactions confirmed in the next block. A line of recent works set forth the desiderata for a "dream" transaction fee mechanism (TFM), and explored whether such a mechanism existed. A dream TFM should satisfy 1) user incentive compatibility (UIC), i.e., truthful bidding should be a user's dominant strategy; 2) miner incentive compatibility (MIC), i.e., the miner's dominant strategy is to faithfully implement the prescribed mechanism; and 3) miner-user side contract proofness (SCP), i.e., no coalition of the miner and one or more user(s) can increase their joint utility by deviating from the honest behavior. The weakest form of SCP is called 1-SCP, where we only aim to provide resilience against the collusion of the miner and a single user. Sadly, despite the various attempts, to the best of knowledge, no existing mechanism can satisfy all three properties in all situations. Since the TFM departs from classical mechanism design in modeling and assumptions, to date, our understanding of the design space is relatively little. In this paper, we further unravel the mathematical structure of transaction fee mechanism design by proving the following results: - Can we have a dream TFM? - Rethinking the incentive compatibility notions. - Do the new design elements make a difference?},

	abstract = {Due to the popularity of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, the increasing digitalization of payments, and the constantly reducing role of cash in society, central banks have shown an increased interest in deploying central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) that could serve as a replacement of cash. While most recent research on CBDCs focuses on blockchain technology, it is not clear that this choice of technology provides the optimal solution. In particular, the centralized trust model of a CBDC offers opportunities for different designs. In this paper, we depart from blockchain designs and instead build on ideas from traditional e-cash schemes. We propose a new style of building digital currencies that combines the transaction processing model of e-cash with the account model of managing funds that is commonly used in blockchain solutions. We argue that such a style of building digital currencies is especially well-suited to CBDCs. We also design the first such digital currency system, called Platypus, that provides strong privacy, massive scalability, and expressive but simple regulation, which are all critical features for a CBDC. Platypus achieves these properties by adapting techniques similar to those used in anonymous blockchain cryptocurrencies like Zcash and applying them to the e-cash context.},

Over the years, informal conventions or "norms" for transaction ordering have, however, emerged via the use of shared software by miners, e.g., the GetBlockTemplate (GBT) mining protocol in Bitcoin Core. Today, a widely held view is that Bitcoin miners prioritize transactions based on their offered "transaction fee-per-byte." Bitcoin users are, consequently, encouraged to increase the fees to accelerate the commitment of their transactions, particularly during periods of congestion. In this paper, we audit the Bitcoin blockchain and present statistically significant evidence of mining pools deviating from the norms to accelerate the commitment of transactions for which they have (i) a selfish or vested interest, or (ii) received dark-fee payments via opaque (non-public) side-channels. As blockchains are increasingly being used as a record-keeping substrate for a variety of decentralized (financial technology) systems, our findings call for an urgent discussion on defining neutrality norms that miners must adhere to when ordering transactions in the chains.

However, vulnerabilities in on-chain autonomous decision-making and cumbersome off-chain coordination have led to serious concerns about blockchain's ability to behave and make decisions in a trustworthy and efficient way. Blockchain governance has received considerable attention to support the decision-making process during the use and evolution of blockchain. Nevertheless, conventional governance frameworks are not applicable to blockchain due to its inherent distributed architecture and decentralised decision process, which leads to the absence of clear source of authority. Currently, there is a lack of systematic guidance on how blockchain governance can be implemented. Therefore, in this paper, we present a comprehensive blockchain governance framework that elucidates an integrated view of the degree of decentralisation, decision rights, incentives, accountability, ecosystem, and legal and ethical responsibilities. The proposed framework is evaluated using four well-known blockchain platforms in terms of feasibility, applicability, and usability.},

This paper presents LayerZero, the first trustless omnichain interoperability protocol, which provides a powerful, low level communication primitive upon which a diverse set of cross-chain applications can be built. Using this new primitive, developers can implement seamless inter-chain applications like a cross-chain DEX or multi-chain yield aggregator without having to rely on a trusted custodian or intermediate transactions. Simply put, LayerZero is the first system to trustlessly enable direct transactions across all chains. Allowing transactions to flow freely between chains provides opportunities for users to consolidate fragmented pockets of liquidity while also making full use of applications on separate chains. With LayerZero, we provide the network fabric underlying the fully-connected omnichain ecosystem of the future.},

Then, it injects system call invocation errors into the Ethereum clients and observes the resulting behavior under perturbation. Finally, ChaosETH compares the behavior recorded before, during, and after perturbation to assess the impact of the injected system call invocation errors. The experiments are performed on the two most popular Ethereum client implementations: GoEthereum and OpenEthereum. We experiment with 22 different types of system call invocation errors. We assess their impact on the Ethereum clients with respect to 15 application-level metrics. Our results reveal a broad spectrum of resilience characteristics of Ethereum clients in the presence of system call invocation errors, ranging from direct crashes to full resilience. The experiments clearly demonstrate the feasibility of applying chaos engineering principles to blockchains.},

	abstract = {Blockchain systems need to solve consensus despite the presence of rational users and failures. The notion of \$(k,t)\$-robustness has shown instrumental to list problems that cannot be solved if \$k\$ players are rational and \$t\$ players are Byzantine or act arbitrarily. What is less clear is whether one can solve such problems if the faults are benign. In this paper, we bridge the gap between games that are robust against Byzantine players and games that are robust against crash players. Our first result is an impossibility result: We show that no \$(k,t)\$-robust consensus protocol can solve consensus in the crash model if \$k+2t{\textbackslash}geq n\$ unless there is a particular punishment strategy, called the \$(k,t)\$-baiting strategy. This reveals the need to introduce baiting as the act of rewarding a colluding node when betraying its coalition, to make blockchains more secure. Our second result is an equivalence relation between crash fault tolerant games and Byzantine fault tolerant games, which raises an interesting research question on the power of baiting to solve consensus. To this end, we show, on the one hand, that a \$(k,t)\$-robust consensus protocol becomes \$(k+t,t)\$-robust in the crash model. We show, on the other hand, that the existence of a \$(k,t)\$-robust consensus protocol in the crash model that does not make use of a baiting strategy implies the existence of a \$(k-t,t)\$-robust consensus protocol in the Byzantine model, with the help of cryptography.},

	abstract = {Smart contract-enabled blockchains allow building decentralized applications in which mutually-distrusted parties can work together. Recently, oracle services emerged to provide these applications with real-world data feeds. Unfortunately, these capabilities have been used for malicious purposes under what is called criminal smart contracts. A few works explored this dark side and showed a variety of such attacks. However, none of them considered collaborative attacks against targets that reside outside the blockchain ecosystem. In this paper, we bridge this gap and introduce a smart contract-based framework that allows a sponsor to orchestrate a collaborative attack among (pseudo)anonymous attackers and reward them for that. While all previous works required a technique to quantify an attacker's individual contribution, which could be infeasible with respect to real-world targets, our framework avoids that. This is done by developing a novel scheme for trustless collaboration through betting. That is, attackers bet on an event (i.e., the attack takes place) and then work on making that event happen (i.e., perform the attack). By taking DDoS as a usecase, we formulate attackers' interaction as a game, and formally prove that these attackers will collaborate in proportion to the amount of their bets in the game's unique equilibrium. We also model our framework and its reward function as an incentive mechanism and prove that it is a strategy proof and budget-balanced one. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to demonstrate the equilibrium behavior of our framework.},

The pseudonymity features of these cryptocurrencies have attracted the attention of cybercriminals, who exploit them to carry out potentially untraceable scams. The wide range of cryptocurrency-based scams observed over the last ten years has fostered the research on the analysis of their effects, and the development of techniques to counter them. However, doing research in this field requires addressing several challenges: for instance, although a few data sources about cryptocurrency scams are publicly available, they often contain incomplete or misclassified data. Further, there is no standard taxonomy of scams, which leads to ambiguous and incoherent interpretations of their nature. Indeed, the unavailability of reliable datasets makes it difficult to train effective automatic classifiers that can detect and analyse cryptocurrency scams. In this paper, we perform an extensive review of the scientific literature on cryptocurrency scams, which we systematise according to a novel taxonomy. By collecting and homogenising data from different public sources, we build a uniform dataset of thousands of cryptocurrency scams.We devise an automatic tool that recognises scams and classifies them according to our taxonomy.We assess the effectiveness of our tool through standard performance metrics.We also give an in-depth analysis of the classification results, offering several insights into threat types, from their features to their connection with other types. Finally, we provide a set of guidelines that policymakers could follow to improve user protection against cryptocurrency scams.},

	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1445},
	abstract = {Payment channels (PC) are a promising solution to the scalability issue of cryptocurrencies, allowing users to perform the bulk of the transactions off-chain without needing to post everything on the blockchain. Many PC proposals however, suffer from a severe limitation: Both parties need to constantly monitor the blockchain to ensure that the other party did not post an outdated transaction. If this event happens, the honest party needs to react promptly and engage in a punishment procedure. This means that prolonged absence periods (e.g., due to a power outage) may be exploited by malicious users. As a mitigation, the community has introduced watchtowers, a third-party monitoring the blockchain on behalf of off-line users. Unfortunately, watchtowers are either trusted, which is critical from a security perspective, or they have to lock a certain amount of coins, called collateral, for each monitored PC in order to be held accountable, which is financially infeasible for a large network.

We present Sleepy Channels, the first bi-directional PC protocol without watchtowers (or any other third party) that supports an unbounded number of payments and does not require parties to be persistently online. The key idea is to confine the period in which PC updates can be validated on-chain to a short, pre-determined time window, which is where the PC parties have to be online. This behavior is incentivized by letting the parties lock a collateral in the PC, which can be adjusted depending on their mutual trust and which they get back much sooner if they are online during this time window. Our protocol is compatible with any blockchain that is capable of verifying digital signatures (e.g., Bitcoin), as shown by our proof of concept. Moreover, Sleepy Channels impose a communication and computation overhead similar to state-of-the-art PC protocols while removing watchtower's collateral and fees for the monitoring service.},

We provide a structured methodology to differentiate between a CeFi and a DeFi service.

	abstract = {Pyramid schemes are investment scams in which top-level participants in a hierarchical network recruit and profit from an expanding base of defrauded newer participants. Pyramid schemes have existed for over a century, but there have been no in-depth studies of their dynamics and communities because of the opacity of participants' transactions. In this paper, we present an empirical study of Forsage, a pyramid scheme implemented as a smart contract and at its peak one of the largest consumers of resources in Ethereum. As a smart contract, Forsage makes its (byte)code and all of its transactions visible on the blockchain. We take advantage of this unprecedented transparency to gain insight into the mechanics, impact on participants, and evolution of Forsage. We quantify the (multi-million-dollar) gains of top-level participants as well as the losses of the vast majority (around 88\%) of users. We analyze Forsage code both manually and using a purpose-built transaction simulator to uncover the complex mechanics of the scheme. Through complementary study of promotional videos and social media, we show how Forsage promoters have leveraged the unique features of smart contracts to lure users with false claims of trustworthiness and profitability, and how Forsage activity is concentrated within a small number of national communities.},

	abstract = {Smart contract is the building block of blockchain systems that enables automated peer-to-peer transactions and decentralized services. With the increasing popularity of smart contracts, blockchain systems, in particular Ethereum, have been the "paradise" of versatile fraud activities in which Ponzi, Honeypot and Phishing are the prominent ones. Formal verification and symbolic analysis have been employed to combat these destructive scams by analyzing the codes and function calls, yet the vulnerability of each {\textbackslash}emph\{individual\} scam should be predefined discreetly. In this work, we present SCSGuard, a novel deep learning scam detection framework that harnesses the automatically extractable bytecodes of smart contracts as their new features. We design a GRU network with attention mechanism to learn from the {\textbackslash}emph\{N-gram bytecode\} patterns, and determines whether a smart contract is fraudulent or not. Our framework is advantageous over the baseline algorithms in three aspects. Firstly, SCSGuard provides a unified solution to different scam genres, thus relieving the need of code analysis skills. Secondly, the inference of SCSGuard is faster than the code analysis by several order of magnitudes. Thirdly, experimental results manifest that SCSGuard achieves high accuracy (0.92\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.94), precision (0.94\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.96{\textbackslash}\%) and recall (0.97\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.98) for both Ponzi and Honeypot scams under similar settings, and is potentially useful to detect new Phishing smart contracts.},

For example, the Bit-coin, as one of the most well-known blockchain platforms, shows that it is possible to transfer money without the need of any (intermediate) bank at all. More generally, it allows for the decentralization of roles. In this paper, we focus on permissionless blockchains, which are systems that allow participation without upfront approval on other parties, as opposed to permissioned blockchains. Permissionless blockchain systems support direct business transactions between peers, so without any intermediate and centralized entity very well. However, the organization of the gover-nance of such systems is less obvious. We argue that, in order to arrive at a really decentralized ecosystem where power is fairly distributed, the governance should be decentralized; in other words, it should not be in the hand of one controlling entity. In this paper, we analyse, in a model-based way, for three well-known blockchain systems (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tezos) the governance processes. Based on this analysis, we draft an improved governance process for permissionless blockchains.},

Existing solutions either restrict the number of users to under-approximate behaviour, or rely on manual proofs. In this paper, we present local bundles that reduce contracts with arbitrarily many users to sequential programs with a few representative users. Each representative user abstracts concrete users that are locally symmetric to each other relative to the contract and the property. Our abstraction is semi-automated. The representatives depend on communication patterns, and are computed via static analysis. A summary for the behaviour of each representative is provided manually, but a default summary is often sufficient. Once obtained, a local bundle is amenable to sequential static analysis. We show that local bundles are relatively complete for parameterized safety verification, under moderate assumptions. We implement local bundle abstraction in SmartACE, and show order-of-magnitude speedups compared to a state-of-the-art verifier.},

We provide refined variants of these attacks, considerably relaxing the requirements on adversarial stake and network timing, and thus rendering the attacks more severe. Combining techniques from both refined attacks, we obtain a third attack which allows an adversary with vanishingly small fraction of stake and no control over network message propagation (assuming instead probabilistic message propagation) to cause even long-range consensus chain reorganizations. Honest-but-rational or ideologically motivated validators could use this attack to increase their profits or stall the protocol, threatening incentive alignment and security of PoS Ethereum. The attack can also lead to destabilization of consensus from congestion in vote processing.},

In this paper, we answer this question by designing a new two-round BFT protocol called Fast-HotStuff, which enjoys responsiveness and efficient view change that is comparable to linear view change in terms of performance.

While redundancy (i.e., offloading a task to more than one service provider) or (partial) reprocessing help to identify correct results, they also lead to significantly higher cost. Hence, within this paper, we present an approach to verify the results of offchain computations via the blockchain. For this, we apply zero-knowledge proofs to provide evidence that results are correct. Using our approach, it is possible to establish trust between a service consumer and arbitrary service providers. We evaluate our approach using a very well-known example task, i.e., the Traveling Salesman Problem.},

	abstract = {With the growing commercial interest in blockchains, permissioned implementations have received increasing attention. Unfortunately, the BFT consensus algorithms that are the backbone of most of these blockchains scale poorly and offer limited throughput. Many state-of-the-art algorithms require a single leader process to receive and validate votes from a quorum of processes and then broadcast the result, which is inherently non-scalable. Recent approaches avoid this bottleneck by using dissemination/aggregation trees to propagate values and collect and validate votes. However, the use of trees increases the round latency, which ultimately limits the throughput for deeper trees. In this paper we propose Kauri, a BFT communication abstraction that can sustain high throughput as the system size grows, leveraging a novel pipelining technique to perform scalable dissemination and aggregation on trees. Our evaluation shows that Kauri outperforms the throughput of state-of-the-art permissioned blockchain protocols, such as HotStuff, by up to 28x. Interestingly, in many scenarios, the parallelization provided by Kauri can also decrease the latency.},

Since then, the attack has been studied extensively in various settings, for understanding its interesting dynamics, optimizing it, and mitigating it. In this context, Heilman (14) ''Freshness Preferred'', we propose a timestamp based defence if timestamps are not generated by an authority. To use this proposal in a decentralized setting, we would like to remove the timestamp authority, but due to two natural and simple attacks this turns out to be a non-trivial task. These attacks are composed of Oracle mining by setting the timestamp to future and Bold mining by generating an alternative chain by starting from a previous block. Unfortunately, these attacks are hard to analyze and optimize, and the available tools, to our knowledge, fail to help us for this task. Thus, we propose generalized formulas for revenue and profitability of SM attacks to ease our job in analysis and optimization of these attacks. Our analyses show that although the use of timestamps would be promising for selfish mining mitigation, Freshness Preferred, in its current form, is quite vulnerable, as any rational miner with a{\textgreater}0 can directly benefit from our attacks. To cope with this problem, we propose an SM mitigation algorithm Fortis with forgeable timestamps (without the need for a trusted authority), which protects the honest miners' shares against any attacker with a{\textless}27.0\% against all the known SM-type attacks. By building upon the blockchain simulator BlockSim by Alharby and Moorsel (2019), we simulate our Oracle and Bold mining attacks against the Freshness Preferred and our Fortis defenses. Similar to our theoretical results, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks against the former and their ineffectiveness against the latter.},

As an illustrative example we show how DPLS can implement a variant of WalkSAT and experimentally demonstrate its competitiveness with respect to a vanilla WalkSAT implementation.

Protocols for rebalancing so far either introduce local solutions or compromise privacy.

In this work, we present an opt-in rebalancing protocol that is both private and globally optimal, meaning our protocol maximizes the total amount of rebalanced funds. We study rebalancing from the framework of linear programming. To obtain full privacy guarantees, we leverage multi-party computation in solving the linear program, which is executed by selected participants to maintain efficiency. Finally, we efficiently decompose the rebalancing solution into incentive-compatible cycles which conserve user balances when executed atomically.},

The knowledge of Ethereum network topology holds the key to understanding Ethereum's security, availability, and user anonymity. From a measurement perspective, an Ethereum network's topology is routing-table information hidden inside individual Ethereum nodes, measuring which poses challenges and remains an open research problem in the existing literature. This paper presents TopoShot, a new method uniquely repurposing Ethereum's transaction replacement/eviction policies for topology measurement. TopoShot can be configured to support Geth, Parity, and other major Ethereum clients. As validated on local nodes, TopoShot achieves 100\% measurement precision and high recall 88\% - 97\%. To efficiently measure the large Ethereum networks in the wild, we propose a non-trivial schedule to run pair-wise measurements in parallel. To enable ethical measurement on Ethereum mainnet, we propose workload-adaptive configurations of TopoShot to minimize the service interruption to target nodes/network. We systematically measure a variety of Ethereum networks and obtain new knowledge including the full-network topology in major testnets (Ropsten, Rinkeby and Goerli) and critical sub-network topology in the mainnet. The results on testnets show interesting graph-theoretic properties, such as all testnets exhibit graph modularity significantly lower than random graphs, implying resilience to network partitions. The mainnet results show biased neighbor selection strategies adopted by critical Ethereum services such as mining pools and transaction relays, implying a degree of centralization in real Ethereum networks.},

Existing verifiable computation techniques all have a high overhead, thus if being deployed in the clouds, would render cloud computing more expensive than the on-premises counterpart. To achieve verifiability at a reasonable cost, we leverage game theory and propose a smart contract based solution. In a nutshell, a client lets two clouds compute the same task, and uses smart contracts to stimulate tension, betrayal and distrust between the clouds, so that rational clouds will not collude and cheat. In the absence of collusion, verification of correctness can be done easily by crosschecking the results from the two clouds. We provide a formal analysis of the games induced by the contracts, and prove that the contracts will be effective under certain reasonable assumptions. By resorting to game theory and smart contracts, we are able to avoid heavy cryptographic protocols. The client only needs to pay two clouds to compute in the clear, and a small transaction fee to use the smart contracts. We also conducted a feasibility study that involves implementing the contracts in Solidity and running them on the official Ethereum network.},

For example, BFT-inspired protocols such as Algorand tend to be secure in the partially synchronous setting, while longest chain protocols like Bitcoin will normally require stronger synchronicity to be secure. Another fundamental distinction, directly relevant to scalability solutions such as sharding, is whether or not a single untrusted user is able to point to *certificates*, which provide incontrovertible proof of block confirmation. Algorand produces such certificates, while Bitcoin does not. Are these properties accidental? Or are they inherent consequences of the paradigm of protocol design? Our aim in this paper is to understand what, fundamentally, governs the nature of security for permissionless blockchain protocols. Using the framework developed in (Lewis-Pye and Roughgarden, 2021), we prove general results showing that these questions relate directly to properties of the user selection process, i.e., the method (such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake) which is used to select users with the task of updating state. Our results suffice to establish, for example, that the production of certificates is impossible for proof-of-work protocols, but is automatic for standard forms of proof-of-stake protocols. As a byproduct of our work, we also define a number of security notions and identify the equivalences and inequivalences among them.},

	abstract = {While quantitative automation related to trading crypto-assets such as ERC-20 tokens has become relatively commonplace, with services such as 3Commas and Shrimpy offering user-friendly web-driven services for even the average crypto trader, we have not yet seen the emergence of on-chain trading as a phenomenon. We hypothesize that just like decentralized exchanges (DEXes) that by now are by some measures more popular than traditional exchanges, process in the space of decentralized finance (DeFi) may enable attractive online trading automation options. In this paper we present ChainBot, an approach for creating algorithmic trading bots with the help of blockchain technology. We show how to partition the computation into on- and off-chain components in a way that provides a measure of end-to-end integrity, while preserving the algorithmic "secret sauce". Our system is enabled with a careful use of algorithm partitioning, zero-knowledge proofs and smart contracts. We also show that with layer-2 (L2) technologies, trades can be kept private, which means that algorithmic parameters are difficult to recover by a chain observer. Our approach offers more transparent access to liquidity and better censorship-resistance compared to traditional off-chain trading approaches. We develop a sample ChainBot and train it on historical data, resulting in returns that are up to 2.4x the buy-and-hold strategy, which we use as our baseline. Our measurements show that across 1000 runs, the end-to-end average execution time for our system is 48.4 seconds. We demonstrate that the frequency of trading does not significantly affect the rate of return and Sharpe ratio, which indicates that we do not have to trade at every block, thereby significantly saving in terms of gas fees. In our implementation, a user who invests {\textbackslash}\$1,000 would earn {\textbackslash}\$105, and spend {\textbackslash}\$3 on gas; assuming a user pool of 1,000 subscribers.},

This is achieved by having for each message a pseudorandomly sampled subset of participants eligible to issue an individual signature; this ensures the scalability of signing, aggregation and verification.

We formalize the primitive in the universal composition setting and propose efficient constructions for STMs. We also showcase that STMs are eminently useful in the cryptocurrency setting by providing two applications: (i) stakeholder decision-making for Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains, specifically, Bitcoin, and (ii) fast bootstrapping for Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains.},

Specifically, IvyCross runs privacy-preserving cross-chain smart contracts atop two distributed TEE-powered hosts, and utilizes a sequential game between rational hosts to guarantee the correctness of contracts execution. IvyCross enables arbitrarily complex smart contracts execution across heterogenous blockchains at low costs. We formally prove the security of IvyCross in the Universal Composability framework. We also implement a prototype of IvyCross atop Bitcoin, Ethereum, and FISCO BOCS. The experiments indicate that (i) IvyCross is able to support privacy-preserving and multiple-round smart contracts for cross-chain communication; (ii) IvyCross successfully decreases the off-chain costs on storage and communication of a TEE without using complex cryptographic primitives; and (iii) the on-chain transaction fees in cross-chain communication are relatively low.},

The attacks use two independently-operated Bitcoin monitors {\textemdash} i.e., Bitnodes and a system of customized supernodes {\textemdash} to confirm that block propagation in Bitcoin is surprisingly slow. In particular, Bitnodes constantly reports that around 30\% of nodes are 3 blocks (or more) behind the blockchain tip and the supernodes show that on average more than 60\% of nodes do not receive the latest block even after waiting for 10 minutes. In this paper, we carefully re-evaluate these controversial claims with our own experiments in the live Bitcoin network and show that block propagation in Bitcoin is, in fact, fast enough (e.g., most peers we monitor receive new blocks in about 4 seconds) for its safety property. We identify several limitations and bugs of the two monitors, which have led to these inaccurate claims about the Bitcoin block synchronization. We finally ask several open-ended questions regarding the technical and ethical issues around monitoring blockchain networks.},

The recent increment in announced cases of security and surveillance breaches compromising patients' privacy call into question the conventional model, in which third-parties gather and control immense amounts of patients' Healthcare data. In this work, we try to resolve the issues mentioned above by using blockchain technology. We propose a blockchain-based protocol suitable for e-health applications that does not require trust in a third party and provides an efficient privacy-preserving access control mechanism. Transactions in our proposed system, unlike Bitcoin, are not entirely financial, and we do not use conventional methods for consensus operations in blockchain like Proof of Work (PoW). It is not suitable for IoT applications because IoT devices have resources-constraints. Usage of appropriate consensus method helps us to increase network security and efficiency, as well as reducing network cost, i.e., bandwidth and processor usage.

Surprisingly, very little is known about the concrete security properties offered by this system. In this work, we propose the first formal analysis of the BIP32 system in its entirety and without any modification. Building on the recent work of Das et al. (CCS `19), we put forth a formal model for hierarchical deterministic wallet systems (such as BIP32) and give a security reduction in this model from the existential unforgeability of the ECDSA signature algorithm that is used in BIP32. We conclude by giving concrete security parameter estimates achieved by the BIP32 standard, and show that by moving to an alternative key derivation method we can achieve a tighter reduction offering an additional 20 bits of security (111 vs. 91 bits of security) at no additional costs.},

Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, currently no exact definition of MEV exists. In this paper, we provide a definition in accordance to its usage throughout the community and show that a narrow definition of MEV fails to capture the extractable value of other actors like users. Moreover, we show that there is no globally unique MEV which can readily be determined. We further highlight why it is hard, or even impossible, to estimate extractable value precisely, considering the uncertainties in real world systems. Finally, we outline a peculiar yet straightforward technique for choosing the security parameter k, which can act as a workaround to transfer the risk of an insufficiently chosen k to another merchant.},

	abstract = {Scalability remains one of the biggest challenges to the adoption of permissioned blockchain technologies for large-scale deployments. Permissioned blockchains typically exhibit low latencies, compared to permissionless deployments -- however at the cost of poor scalability. Various solutions were proposed to capture "the best of both worlds", targeting low latency and high scalability simultaneously, the most prominent technique being blockchain sharding. However, most existing sharding proposals exploit features of the permissionless model and are therefore restricted to cryptocurrency applications. We present MITOSIS, a novel approach to practically improve scalability of permissioned blockchains. Our system allows the dynamic creation of blockchains, as more participants join the system, to meet practical scalability requirements. Crucially, it enables the division of an existing blockchain (and its participants) into two -- reminiscent of mitosis, the biological process of cell division. MITOSIS inherits the low latency of permissioned blockchains while preserving high throughput via parallel processing. Newly created chains in our system are fully autonomous, can choose their own consensus protocol, and yet they can interact with each other to share information and assets -- meeting high levels of interoperability. We analyse the security of MITOSIS and evaluate experimentally the performance of our solution when instantiated over Hyperledger Fabric. Our results show that MITOSIS can be ported with little modifications and manageable overhead to existing permissioned blockchains, such as Hyperledger Fabric.},

By applying two novel heuristics, we can effectively pinpoint 25,070 Wasabi and 134,569 Samourai transactions within the first 689,255 (2021-07-01) blocks. Our study reveals a somewhat steady adoption of these services and found a growing trend with a total amount of 190,777.11 mixed BTC with a value of ca. 3.02 B USD. Within the recent six months, we measured an average monthly mixing throughput of 5410.98 BTC (ca. 240.14 M USD). Among all actors, which were directly or indirectly involved in CoinJoins, we also found a lower-bound of 32 distinct exchanges and traced a lower-bound of 6683.19 BTC (ca. 95.98 M USD) mixed coins received by exchanges. Our analysis further shows that linking heuristics over Wasabi and Samourai transactions allows us to narrow down the anonymity set provided by these wallets over time. Furthermore, we estimate the number of mixing outputs that are handled in Wasabi and Samourai correspondingly over time. Overall, this is the first paper to provide a comprehensive picture of the adoption of distributed CoinJoin and to discuss implications for end-users, cryptoasset exchanges, and regulatory bodies.},

Replication (SMR) world and many state-of-the-art blockchain-SMR so-

an undesirable behavior: crashed parties become designated leaders in-

provide a new Leader-Aware SMR framework that, among other desir-
able properties, formalizes a Leader-utilization requirement that bounds
the number of rounds whose leaders are faulty in crash-only executions.
We introduce Carousel, a novel, reputation-based Leader-rotation solu-
tion to achieve Leader-Aware SMR. The challenge in adaptive Leader-
rotation is that it cannot rely on consensus to determine a leader, since
consensus itself needs a leader. Carousel uses the available on-chain in-
formation to determine a leader locally and achieves Liveness despite this
difficulty. A HotStuff implementation fitted with Carousel demonstrates
drastic performance improvements: it increases throughput over 2x in
faultless settings and provided a 20x throughput increase and 5x latency

	abstract = {Despite the tremendous interest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum today, many aspects of the underlying consensus protocols are poorly understood. Therefore, the search for protocols that improve either throughput or security (or both) continues. Bitcoin always selects the longest chain (i.e., the one with most work). Forks may occur when two miners extend the same block simultaneously, and the frequency of forks depends on how fast blocks are propagated in the network. In the GHOST protocol, used by Ethereum, all blocks involved in the fork contribute to the security. However, the greedy chain selection rule of GHOST does not consider the full information available in the block tree, which has led to some concerns about its security. This paper introduces a new family of protocols, called Medium, which takes the structure of the whole block tree into account, by weighting blocks differently according to their depths. Bitcoin and GHOST result as special cases. This protocol leads to new insights about the security of Bitcoin and GHOST and paves the way for developing network- and application-specific protocols, in which the influence of forks on the chain-selection process can be controlled. It is shown that almost all protocols in this family achieve strictly greater throughput than Bitcoin (at the same security level) and resist attacks that can be mounted against GHOST.},

However, the related work lacks a thorough investigation of corner cases that deviate from the protocol in terms of transaction selection strategy. Therefore, we build a custom simulator that extends open source simulation tools to support multiple chains and enables us to investigate such corner cases. Our experiments show that malicious actors who diverge from the proposed transaction selection strategy make more profit as compared to honest miners. Moreover, they have a detrimental effect on the processing throughput of the PHANTOM (and GHOSTDAG) due to same transactions being included in more than one block of different chains. Finally, we show that multiple miners not following the transaction selection strategy are incentivized to create a shared mining pool instead of mining independently, which has a negative impact on decentralization.},

	abstract = {Off-chain protocols constitute one of the most promising approaches to solve the inherent scalability issue of blockchain technologies. The core idea is to let parties transact on-chain only once to establish a channel between them, leveraging later on the resulting channel paths to perform arbitrarily many peer-to-peer transactions off-chain. While significant progress has been made in terms of proof techniques for off-chain protocols, existing approaches do not capture the game-theoretic incentives at the core of their design, which led to overlooking significant attack vectors like the Wormhole attack in the past. This work introduces the first game-theoretic model that is expressive enough to reason about the security of off-chain protocols. We advocate the use of Extensive Form Games - EFGs and introduce two instances of EFGs to capture security properties of the closing and the routing of the Lightning Network. Specifically, we model the closing protocol, which relies on punishment mechanisms to disincentivize the uploading on-chain of old channel states, as well as the routing protocol, thereby formally characterizing the Wormhole attack, a vulnerability that undermines the fee-based incentive mechanism underlying the Lightning Network.},

	abstract = {Decentralized control, low-complexity, flexible and efficient communications are the requirements of an architecture that aims to scale blockchains beyond the current state. Such properties are attainable by reducing ledger size and providing parallel operations in the blockchain. Sharding is one of the approaches that lower the burden of the nodes and enhance performance. However, the current solutions lack the features for resolving concurrency during cross-shard communications. With multiple participants belonging to different shards, handling concurrent operations is essential for optimal sharding. This issue becomes prominent due to the lack of architectural support and requires additional consensus for cross-shard communications. Inspired by hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake (PoW/PoS), like Ethereum, hybrid consensus and 2-hop blockchain, we propose Reinshard, a new blockchain that inherits the properties of hybrid consensus for optimal sharding. Reinshard uses PoW and PoS chain-pairs with PoS sub-chains for all the valid chain-pairs where the hybrid consensus is attained through Verifiable Delay Function (VDF). Our architecture provides a secure method of arranging nodes in shards and resolves concurrency conflicts using the delay factor of VDF. The applicability of Reinshard is demonstrated through security and experimental evaluations. A practical concurrency problem is considered to show the efficacy of Reinshard in providing optimal sharding.},

	abstract = {One fundamental limitation of blockchain-based smart contracts is that they execute in a closed environment. Thus, they only have access to data and functionality that is already on the blockchain, or is fed into the blockchain. Any interactions with the real world need to be mediated by a bridge service, which is called an oracle. As decentralized applications mature, oracles are playing an increasingly prominent role. With their evolution comes more attacks, necessitating greater attention to their trust model. In this systemization of knowledge paper (SoK), we dissect the design alternatives for oracles, showcase attacks, and discuss attack mitigation strategies.},

	shorttitle = {{PHANTOM} and {GHOSTDAG}},
	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104},
	abstract = {In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto invented the basis for blockchain-based distributed ledgers. The core concept of this system is an open and anonymous network of nodes, or miners, which together maintain a public ledger of transactions. The ledger takes the form of a chain of blocks, the blockchain, where each block is a batch of new transactions collected from users. One primary problem with Satoshi's blockchain is its highly limited scalability. The security of Satoshi's longest chain rule, more generally known as the Bitcoin protocol, requires that all honest nodes be aware of each other's blocks very soon after the block's creation. To this end, the throughput of the system is artificially suppressed so that each block fully propagates before the next one is created, and that very few ``orphan blocks'' that fork the chain be created spontaneously.

PHANTOM solves an optimization problem over the blockDAG to distinguish between blocks mined properly by honest nodes and those created by non-cooperating nodes who chose to deviate from the mining protocol. Using this distinction, PHANTOM provides a robust total order on the blockDAG in a way that is eventually agreed upon by all honest nodes. Implementing PHANTOM requires solving an NP-hard problem, and to avoid this prohibitive computation, we devised an efficient greedy algorithm GHOSTDAG that captures the essence of PHANTOM.

We provide a formal proof of the security of GHOSTDAG, namely, that its ordering of blocks is irreversible up to an exponentially negligible factor. We discuss the properties of GHOSTDAG and how it compares to other DAG based protocols.},

	abstract = {Single Secret Leader Elections have recently been proposed as an improved leader election mechanism for proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains. However, the security gain they provide has not been quantified. In this work, we present a comparison of PoS longest-chain protocols that are based on Single Secret Leader Elections (SSLE) - that elect exactly one leader per round - versus those based on Probabilistic Leader Elections (PLE) - where one leader is elected on expectation. Our analysis shows that when considering the private attack - the worst attack on longest-chain protocols - the security gained from using SSLE is substantial: the settlement time is decreased by roughly 25\% for a 33\% or 25\% adversary. Furthermore, when considering grinding attacks, we find that the security threshold is increased by 10\% (from 0.26 in the PLE case to 0.36 inthe SSLE case) and the settlement time is decreased by roughly 70\% for a 20\% adversary in the SSLE case.},

Atop the prior work, which focused on spatial partitioning, our work extends the analysis of the Bitcoin network to understand the temporal and logical effects on the robustness of the Bitcoin network.},

	shorttitle = {Clover},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00376},
	abstract = {The Bitcoin P2P network currently represents a reference benchmark for modern cryptocurrencies. Its underlying protocol defines how transactions and blocks are distributed through all participating nodes. To protect user privacy, the identity of the node originating a message is kept hidden. However, an adversary observing the whole network can analyze the spread pattern of a transaction to trace it back to its source. This is possible thanks to the so-called rumor centrality, which is caused by the symmetry in the spreading of gossip-like protocols. Recent works try to address this issue by breaking the symmetry of the Diffusion protocol, currently used in Bitcoin, and leveraging proxied broadcast. Nonetheless, the complexity of their design can be a barrier to their adoption in real life. In this work, we propose Clover, a novel transaction relay protocol that protects the source of transaction messages with a simple, yet effective, design. Compared to previous solutions, our protocol does not require building propagation graphs, and reduces the ability of the adversary to gain precision by opening multiple connections towards the same node. Experimental results show that the deanonymization accuracy of an eavesdropper adversary against Clover is up to 10 times smaller compared to Diffusion.},

	abstract = {Proof-of-Work mining is intended to provide blockchains with robustness against double-spend attacks. However, an economic analysis that follows from Budish (2018), which considers free entry conditions together with the ability to rent sufficient hashrate to conduct an attack, suggests that the resulting block rewards can make an attack cheap. We formalize a defense to double-spend attacks. We show that when the victim can counterattack in the same way as the attacker, this leads to a variation on the classic game-theoretic War of Attrition model. The threat of this kind of counterattack induces a subgame perfect equilibrium in which no attack occurs in the first place.},
