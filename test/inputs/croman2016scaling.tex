\section{On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains}
\bibentry{croman2016scaling}

\textbf{Abstract:} 
The increasing popularity of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies has made scalability a primary and urgent concern. We analyze how fundamental  and  circumstantial  bottlenecks  in  Bitcoin  limit  the  ability of its current peer-to-peer overlay network to support substantially higher throughputs and lower latencies. Our results suggest that reparameterization of block size and intervals should be viewed only as a first increment toward achieving next-generation, high-load blockchain protocols, and major advances will additionally require a basic rethinking of technical  approaches.  We  offer  a  structured  perspective  on  the  design space for such approaches. Within this perspective, we enumerate and briefly  discuss  a  number  of  recently  proposed  protocol  ideas  and  offer several new ideas and open challenges.
